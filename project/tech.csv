IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has refuted the narrative that the current wave of mass layoffs across the tech industry is primarily due to the artificial intelligence (AI) technology, arguing that the job cuts are largely a “natural correction” following over-hiring during the pandemic years. Krishna, however, acknowledged that AI will eventually lead to some job displacement, but suggested that many companies are currently laying off staff because they overhired between 2020 and 2023.In an interview with The Verge, Krishna used strong terms to describe the rapid staffing increases across the industry during the lockdown era.""If you look at the total employment numbers, I think people gorged on employment... during the pandemic and the year after,"" Krishna explained. He noted that some companies saw their employee count spike by ""30, 40, 50, 100 percent"" from 2020 to 2023.“There is going to be some natural correction. Business is never completely optimized. I think in engineering terms, it’s an underdamped system. When there’s a need, it goes above. Now, it has to correct. It’s probably going to go below what’s needed, and then it’ll hit the correct equilibrium, depending on market demand and growth,” the CEO noted.Notably, earlier this year, IBM announced that it will lay off thousands of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025. It was reported that the company will layoff about 1% of its total workforce – around 2700 employees – by the end of this year.Talking about the long-term impact of AI on employment, Krishna projected a significant but manageable level of job displacement over the next couple of years.“Could there be up to 10 percent job displacement? I believe that’ll be likely over the next couple of years. It’s not 30 or 40 percent, but it is up to 10 percent of the total US employment pool. It is very concentrated in certain areas,"" he said.Krishna also believes that as AI increases overall productivity, companies will ultimately hire more people, though in different roles.“Now, as you get more productive, companies are going to then hire more people but in different places. We are hiring more because people say, “I don’t need to do the entry-level task because an AI agent can do it.” I’m looking at them like, “Really?” Think strategically for a moment,” the CEO noted.Krishna criticised companies that are looking to AI primarily as a cost-cutting measure for entry-level tasks, calling the approach ""shortsighted.""“Wouldn’t you rather have an entry-level person and AI makes them more like a 10-year expert? Isn’t that more useful to me than the other way around? Otherwise, where is the talent who’s going to come up with the next great product? Where is the person who’s going to be able to convince a client to deploy technology the way it should be deployed? That’s why I think some are being shortsighted,” he noted.Last month, Krishna said that the company will continue to hire more college graduates.“People are talking about either layoffs or freezing hiring, but I actually want to say that we are the opposite. I expect we are probably going to hire more people out of college over the next 12 months than we have in the past few years, so you’re going to see that,” Krishna told CNN.","IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has refuted the narrative that the current wave of mass layoffs across the tech industry is primarily due to the artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

South Korea PM Lee Nak-yon pushes stronger data protection laws after Coupang breach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/south-korea-pm-lee-nak-yon-pushes-stronger-data-protection-laws-after-coupang-breach/articleshow/125719328.cms,"Regulatory push



Coupang apologises over massive data breach







Coupang, South Korea's largest e-commerce platform often dubbed the “Amazon.com of South Korea,” recently faced a massive data breach. The system of the company were illegally accessed causing a massive data breach and affecting the personal information of 33.7 million customer accounts. The breach was first detected by the company on November 18 but it believes the unauthorised access to customer accounts began on June 24 and was executed through overseas servers. Coupang says that the compromised information is limited to basic personal data and the highly sensitive financial details remain secure. Now, the South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has called for stronger penalties against companies that fail to protect consumer data.As reported by Reuters, Lee emphasised that the companies must face tougher consequences when they fail to protect personal information. “We cannot allow negligence in data protection to go unpunished,” he said, urging lawmakers to strengthen penalties and enforcement measures.Along with this, Lee also stressed that protecting the trust of the consumer is of critical importance for South Korea’s digital economy, which heavily relies on e-commerce and online services.He also called for closer cooperation between government agencies and private firms to prevent future breaches.For the uninitiated, South Korea already has some strict data privacy laws under the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA). However, the critics argue that enforcement of the laws has been inconsistent and the penalties are also lenient. The recent Coupang data breach has intensified the calls for higher fines and reforms.Coupang has also apologised for the data leak and urged customers to be wary of phone calls, text messages or other communications impersonating the company. The company also said that it has launched an investigation with security experts into the incident and is working with law enforcement as well as regulatory authorities.Notably, on November 20, Coupang reported a data leak involving about 4,500 customers. At that time, the company said that it had found no evidence of unauthorised access to payment information or into its systems.The latest incident surpasses SK Telecom's data leak in April. It affected 23.2 million users, resulting in a record fine of 134.8 billion won.","South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has called for stronger penalties against companies that fail to protect consumer data.

Bernie Sanders bankruptcy warning



Bernie Sanders warning on the rise of AI







US senator Bernie Sanders has once again raised an alarm on medical debt crises in America. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Sanders highlights that more than 530,000 America will go bankrupt annually because of the cost of healthcare. In the post, Sanders also drew comparisons of US with other countries like Germany, Canada, France and Japan, where the number of medical bankruptcies is zero.In post shared on X, Sanders shared a chart highlighting the disparity. He mentioned that while advanced economies across Europe and Asia report no medical bankruptcies, the United States stands alone with 530,000 cases each year. “Yes. We need Medicare for All — NOW,” Sanders wrote, underscoring his long-standing push for universal healthcare. He further argued that the present system in the US compels ordinary Americans into financial ruin simply because they get sick, calling it a moral and economic failure.The figures highlighted by Sanders come from a 2019 American Journal of Public health study. The study estimated that medical issues contribute to hundred of thousands of bankruptcies annually. While some analysts debate the methodology, the number has become a rallying point for advocates of healthcare reform.Sanders’ post has reignited debate about the U.S. healthcare system, which remains the most expensive in the world yet leaves millions uninsured or underinsured.Last month, the US senator issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the rise of artificial intelligence. In an interview with NBC News, Sanders said that the technology’s explosive growth risks concentrating wealth and power among a handful of billionaires while leaving ordinary workers behind. Sanders cautioned that AI’s military applications could reshape global conflict. “I think we are not all that far away from the development of robotic soldiers,” he said. “If you don’t have to worry about loss of life, and what you worry about is loss of robots, what does that mean for issues of war and peace globally? It’s a big issue.”","US senator Bernie Sanders has once again raised an alarm on medical debt crises in America.

"Google's Gemini forces OpenAI CEO Sam Altman send 'Code Red' warning to employees, two years after ChatGPT did same to Google",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-gemini-forces-openai-ceo-sam-altman-send-code-red-warning-to-employees-two-years-after-chatgpt-did-same-to-google/articleshow/125718598.cms,"OpenAI faces an internal 'code red' as Google's Gemini surges ahead, forcing a halt on revenue plans to fix ChatGPT's performance. Google's integrated infrastructure and custom chips give it a decisive edge. OpenAI's pivot highlights intense competition and financial pressures, as it scrambles to regain ground against a resurgent tech giant.

Google's infrastructure advantage proves decisive

Financial pressures compound OpenAI’s strategic challenges





Three years after ChatGPT's explosive debut sent Google into panic mode, the tables have turned spectacularly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared an internal ""code red"" emergency, ordering employees to halt work on advertising and revenue-generating features to fix ChatGPT's deteriorating competitive position as Google's Gemini 3 model surges ahead on performance benchmarks, user engagement, and market share—a reversal that threatens the $500 billion startup's future while vindicating Google's patient, infrastructure-heavy approach to artificial intelligence.OpenAI is abandoning plans to introduce advertising, AI shopping assistants, health agents, and its Pulse personal assistant, according to internal memos obtained by The Wall Street Journal and The Information. Instead, all resources will redirect toward improving ChatGPT's speed, reliability, and personalisation as the company confronts what Altman called ""temporary economic headwinds"" from Google's aggressive AI offensive. The staff working on chatbot will have to attend daily calls as the development sprints toward an “even more intuitive and personal,” as described by ChatGPT's head Nick Turley.""We are at a critical time for ChatGPT,"" Altman wrote in memo, first reported by The Information. The directive escalates OpenAI's internal alert level from ""code orange"" to ""code red""—the company's highest urgency designation for existential threats.The retreat comes as a remarkable role reversal from December 2022, when ChatGPT's launch forced Google CEO Sundar Pichai to issue his own ""code red"" that restructured entire divisions and accelerated AI development timelines.Google's comeback stems from advantages OpenAI cannot easily replicate. Its Gemini user base rocketed from 450 million monthly active users in July to 650 million in October, while web analytics firm Similarweb reports users now spend more time with Gemini than ChatGPT—despite OpenAI claiming 800 million weekly users.More fundamentally, Google controls what insiders call the ""full stack."" DeepMind researchers build models, proprietary TPU chips train them cheaply, Google Cloud hosts them efficiently, and seamless integration delivers them across Search, YouTube, Gmail, and 3 billion Android devices. OpenAI depends on Microsoft's cloud infrastructure and Nvidia's expensive chips, creating structural cost disadvantages.""One of the most important things for us at Google is this is possible because we have a very differentiated full-stack approach,"" DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu told reporters, noting the company trains models on custom silicon while deploying them immediately into products.Google's latest Gemini 3 model has outperformed OpenAI's GPT-5 on industry benchmarks, while its Nano Banana Pro image generator has gained significant traction. Anthropic's Opus 4.5 model also beat GPT-5 in key tests, squeezing OpenAI from multiple directions.OpenAI isn't alone in feeling the tremors from Gemini 3's success. Nvidia's stock plummeted over 6%, erasing roughly $250 billion in market value, after reports emerged that Meta Platforms—one of OpenAI's fellow mega-customers—is in advanced talks to purchase billions of dollars worth of Google's TPU chips instead of Nvidia's GPUs. The chipmaker, which supplies the expensive hardware powering OpenAI's models and has built a near-monopoly on AI infrastructure, now faces the prospect of losing up to 10% of its annual revenue as Google's custom silicon proves both cheaper and, for certain workloads, more efficient than Nvidia's flagship products.The pivot comes as OpenAI confronts brutal financial realities. The Wall Street Journal reported the company must reach roughly $200 billion in annual revenue by 2030 to achieve profitability—requiring 100-fold growth while burning billions quarterly on compute costs and talent.Google generates $120 billion annually with nearly $100 billion in cash reserves, giving it unlimited capacity to undercut OpenAI on pricing or outspend on research. The search giant can afford to offer advanced models free while OpenAI desperately needs to monetize.Altman attempted to reassure employees that a new reasoning model launching next week would surpass Gemini 3's capabilities. ""I wouldn't trade positions with any other company,"" he wrote, according to sources familiar with the memo.But the emergency directive—and the shelving of advertising plans OpenAI needs to survive—suggests deeper anxiety about whether the ChatGPT pioneer can maintain its early lead against a tech giant finally operating at full throttle.","Google's Gemini 3 model has outperformed OpenAI's GPT-5 on industry benchmarks, user engagement, and market share.

How the Foxconn partnership can help OpenAI





“Foxconn is uniquely positioned to support OpenAI’s mission with trusted, scalable infrastructure,”





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is partnering with Taiwan's Foxconn to design and build artificial intelligence (AI) data centre components within the US. This partnership is the AI startup's newest step in its extensive infrastructure development plans. The companies stated the goal is to accelerate infrastructure deployment and secure long-term US capacity for essential AI components. While financial terms were not disclosed, OpenAI confirmed it will have early access to evaluate the systems produced by the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple ’s largest supplier, along with the option to purchase them.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the partnership, saying:adding that AI infrastructure presents aUnder the agreement, OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities, which are located in Wisconsin, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Indiana.Foxconn adds another manufacturing layer to OpenAI’s supply chain, which could help make production for the AI startup more local and speed up deployment.The company is widely known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, but it has also expanded into AI and automotive manufacturing. It builds server racks designed for AI workloads and is an important global supplier to Nvidia, a major producer of high-end AI chips.Chairman Young Liu said to CNBC.However, the company has had mixed results in the US. In 2018, Foxconn began construction of a large factory in Wisconsin intended to make flat-panel displays. The project did not succeed, and the site is now being used for an AI data centre under construction by Microsoft.OpenAI has recently made several major agreements with some of the world’s biggest technology companies, announcing spending plans of about $1.4 trillion.These commitments have raised questions about whether the company will eventually generate enough profit to support that level of investment.Earlier this month, Altman said the company expects to reach $20 billion in annualised revenue by the end of the year and aims to reach hundreds of billions by 2030.Previous deals include a $100 billion agreement (yet to be finalised) with Nvidia, under which the chipmaker would invest in OpenAI in phases as the company expands its infrastructure.OpenAI also has cloud partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, as well as significant compute buildout commitments with Oracle.","OpenAI and Foxconn will co-develop multiple generations of AI servers and manufacture core components, which include power, networking, and cooling systems, at Foxconn’s US facilities.

John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

Microsoft has confirmed that it is internally testing an ad-supported, free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which will allow users to stream select titles without requiring a paid Game Pass subscription. The company has officially confirmed this tier is going to be a separate tier from the existing game pass subscription, according to a report by The New York Times.The initiative aims to significantly broaden access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, which has previously been bundled exclusively with the Game Pass subscription.Earlier this month, a report by The Verge claimed that the software giant has already begun testing the free tier among employees.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

Vembu emphasized the strong trajectory of Zoho's customer base, casting doubt on the effectiveness of AI-generated applications for the nuanced requirements of businesses and raising alarms about potential technological debt.

'Vibe coding piles up tech debt until everything collapses': Vembu

Google CEO Sundar Pichai

backs vibe coding as tech industry remains split on AI development tools





Zoho founder and Chief Scientist Sridhar Vembu has fired back at Y Combinator President Garry Tan after the American venture capitalist predicted that AI-powered ""vibe coding"" would make the Indian SaaS giant obsolete. The public spat on X has ignited a fierce debate about whether artificial intelligence can truly replace traditional enterprise software.Tan had claimed that companies like Zoho would be among the first to face disruption from people building custom software using platforms like Replit, Emergent Labs and Taskade,Tan had claimed that companies like Zoho would be the first casualty of vibe coding—a trend where non-technical users build custom apps using AI platforms like Replit, Emergent Labs and Taskade. questioning why businesses would pay subscription fees when non-technical staff could create solutions over a weekend.""Why pay $30/seat/month for over-bundled SaaS when soon even nontech ops people can vibe-code a custom solution in a weekend?"" he wrote.Vembu dismissed the prediction outright, pointing to Zoho's customer base growing at over 50%. ""If our business would be the first to be competed away by vibe coded apps, why are we seeing such rapid customer growth right now?"" he countered.He also challenged Tan to explain why vibe-coded alternatives don't exist yet for email, spreadsheets, accounting or messaging—core enterprise tools that require deep engineering.The Zoho founder delivered a scathing assessment of vibe coding's limitations, warning that AI-generated applications accumulate unsustainable technical debt without proper security, privacy and compliance safeguards. ""Without those guarantees, vibe coding just piles up tech debt faster and faster until the whole thing collapses,"" Vembu wrote.He revealed his own R&D focus: combining compiler technology with AI to dramatically boost programmer productivity while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability. Taking a personal shot at Tan, Vembu suggested venture capitalists like him view technical debt as something to ""pawn off on unsuspecting acquirers"" rather than a serious liability.The exchange concluded with Vembu throwing down a gauntlet: ""Let me make a bet with Garry Tan: we will outshine and outlast his vibe coding companies!""The war of words comes as Silicon Valley remains deeply divided over vibe coding's future. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has championed vibe coding as democratizing programming, allowing anyone to build apps without knowing Python or JavaScript. He recently called Google's Gemini 3 their ""best vibe-coding model ever.""Meanwhile, Vembu indirectly hit back at Pichai's optimism, arguing that real coding involves deep complexity with ""magic all the way down""—a reference to the intricate compiler processes that AI tools gloss over.But Vembu's skepticism resonates with many developers who've seen AI-generated prototypes fail under real-world pressure. Industry observers note that while vibe coding works for quick demos, it struggles with sensitive data handling, compliance audits and scaling demands. Major tech firms now report AI generates 25-30% of their code, but the debate over quality versus speed remains unresolved as vibe coding startups continue their explosive growth.","Y Combinator President Garry Tan predicted that AI-powered 'vibe coding' would make Indian SaaS giant Zoho obsolete.

When ChatGPT made Japan's second-richest man Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son 'cry',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-chatgpt-made-japans-second-richest-man-softbank-ceo-masayoshi-son-cry/articleshow/125717037.cms,"Son bets on the AI future, says no AI bubble



When Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made fun of Softbank founder







Masayoshi Son, SoftBank Group CEO, has revealed that the company’s decision to sell its substantial stake in Nvidia was a painful, though necessary, step taken to fund its aggressive new investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including a major commitment to OpenAI . Addressing the November disclosure that SoftBank had completely unloaded its shares worth $5.83 billion in the world’s most valuable chipmaker, Son expressed deep regret, figuratively admitting he ‘cried’ when he sold shares of the biggest tech company in terms of market cap.“I don’t want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects,” Son told attendees at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo on Monday (December 2). “I was crying to sell Nvidia shares,” Japan’s second richest man added.Son’s comments clarified that SoftBank needed immediate capital and selling was driven by a string of expansive AI projects. These projects include construction of a massive Stargate data centre in partnership with Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (commonly known as Foxconn), the acquisition of US chip designer Ampere Computing, and accelerated plans to increase investment in OpenAI by the end of the year.The Japanese tech executive also dismissed that the current surge in AI spending represents an investment bubble.“People who talk about a bubble around AI investment are not smart enough,” the 68-year-old CEO highlighted. Son argued that if AI eventually captures even 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) over the long term, this return would easily justify trillions of dollars in cumulative spending.“Where is the bubble?” he questioned.The ‘cry’ comment brought back a year-old memory about the conversation between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Son. During Huang's visit to Japan last November, he publicly ‘teased’ Son over his past investment timing.Huang once introduced Son on stage by praising him as the “only entrepreneur, only innovator in the world that has selected the winner and partnered with the winner in every single generation,” citing his crucial roles in introducing giants like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs to Japan and backing Alibaba.Huang then delivered the punchline: “You maybe many of you probably don't know this, but at one point, Masa was the largest shareholder of Nvidia.”This was a mention of the massive, missed returns by Son, who then playfully rested his head on Huang's shoulder as if weeping. Huang responded with mock sympathy, “It's okay. We can cry. We can cry together. Could you imagine? If today, you are the largest shareholder. Oh, my God.”","Masayoshi Son, SoftBank Group CEO, has revealed that the company’s decision to sell its substantial stake in Nvidia was a painful, though necessary, step taken to fund its aggressive new investments in artificial intelligence. “I was crying to sell Nvidia shares,” Son told attendees at the FII Priority Asia forum in Tokyo on Monday (December 2)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125717023,imgsize-22694,width-400,resizemode-4/softbank-ceo-and-founder-masayoshi-son.jpg"

Google combines data and feedback on AI products







Google CEO Sundar Pichai has revealed a hands-on approach to evaluating the success of major company product launches. Recently, in a podcast, Pichai said that he dedicates significant time on launch day to personally monitor public reception and user experience on social media platforms, like Elon Musk’s X (Twitter). The CEO explained that while internal teams rely on advanced dashboards and metrics, he looks forward to the unfiltered feedback to understand if a new product, such as the Gemini AI models, is making sense for the consumers.“I’m one of one of those people. I need to feel it firsthand, right?” Pichai said, adding, “So I get reports, but I'm out there trying to understand how people are using it, what they are posting. And I think that is important.”Pichai specifically mentioned using the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on launch days to gauge public sentiment and usage.“I'm pretty active on launch day trying to understand what's working. I'm looking for feedback. I'm on X trying to understand [and] see if people, average users, how they're experiencing the product,” Pichai said on the company podcast.This method allows Pichai to assess feedback instantly and because the “first day” of a launch is crucial for getting an authentic sense of what is working well and what is not.“I probably ping people back saying, ‘this is a valid point, we should address it’. So, in some sense, I'm looking at that trying to assess it,” he addedPichai also acknowledged that his personal monitoring combined with Google's robust internal data collection gives an idea of what is working and what is not. He noted that teams use tools like Gemini itself to collect and collate information, and he regularly reviews complex dashboards tracking metrics like Queries Per Second (QPS) and usage capacity.“But I walk over to some people who all have these big screens with multiple dashboards looking at QPS and you know understanding how the usage is worried about capacity but all that gives you a real sense of what people are saying but that's how I do it,” Pichai said.“It's a combination of monitoring stuff online, talking to people, walking around, and sitting down with people, particularly the first day. It really helps me get a sense of what's working, what's not working well,” he concluded.Pichai has become more vocal on social media. He has had several conversations with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and even replied to several congratulatory messages after the launch of Google Gemini 3.0 AI model.For example, he recently posted about the launch of the Nano Banana Pro model, suggesting that he has been looking at the feedback on social media.“You went 🍌🍌[Bananas] for Nano Banana. Now, meet Nano Banana Pro. It’s SOTA for image generation + editing with more advanced world knowledge, text rendering, precision + controls.

It's designed to fight phone scams and theft, and it's already been a big help, recovering tons of stolen devices and stopping millions of fake phone lines. Even though Apple might push back, the government says you can ditch the app if you want.

Telecom minister clarifies: Sanchar Saathi app not mandatory to keep, can be deleted





The government has mandated that all smartphones sold in the country must come pre-installed with Sanchar Saathi, a cybersecurity application. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued the directive on November 28, 2025, under the Telecommunication Cybersecurity Amendment Rules, marking the first time India has required state-backed software on all mobile devices. The move affects one of the world's largest smartphone markets, with over 1.2 billion mobile users.Sanchar Saathi, launched in January 2025, is described by DoT as a ""citizen centric initiative"" designed to empower mobile subscribers and strengthen their security against telecom-related cyber threats. The app is available both as a mobile application and through a web portal at www.sancharsaathi.gov.in, offering various services aimed at protecting India's 1.2 billion mobile users from fraud and device theft.According to government data, the platform has already demonstrated significant impact, helping recover over 700,000 lost phones, blocking more than 3.7 million stolen devices, and terminating 30 million fraudulent mobile connections.The DoT justifies the initiative by citing the prevalence of duplicate or spoofed IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) numbers, which pose serious cybersecurity threats.The department also notes that India's large second-hand mobile device market has seen cases of stolen or blacklisted devices being resold, making purchasers unwitting participants in crime.The app offers several practical services for users. Through its ""Chakshu"" feature, citizens can report suspected fraud communications, including impersonation scams involving government officials, banks, or police, as well as unsolicited commercial communications (spam). Users can also report malicious web links received through SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other platforms.Another feature allows users to block and trace lost or stolen mobile devices using the phone's unique 15-digit IMEI code. Once blocked through the app, the device becomes unusable across all networks, even if the SIM card is changed.The app also enables users to verify how many mobile connections are registered in their name, helping them identify unauthorized SIM cards. Additionally, users can check the genuineness of their mobile handset by scanning its IMEI barcode to ensure they haven't purchased stolen or counterfeit devices.The directive has encountered resistance from major smartphone manufacturers, particularly Apple. According to Reuters, Apple does not plan to comply with the mandate to preload its smartphones with the state-owned cyber safety app and will convey its concerns to New Delhi, three sources said.While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android devices, Apple's iOS powers an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint, told Reuters that ""Apple has historically refused such requests from governments,"" suggesting potential friction ahead as the 90-day compliance deadline approaches.Initially, the DoT directive reportedly stated that the pre-installed application must be ""readily visible and accessible"" to users during device setup and that its functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted. This sparked questions about user choice and flexibility. However, Minister Scindia quickly addressed these concerns, emphasizing that the app is not mandatory for use.""If you want to delete the app, you can, it is not mandatory. For instance, if you don't want to use the app, don't register for it, it will stay dormant, and delete it if you want to,"" Scindia explained. He added that the government's responsibility is to make the app available to everyone, as many citizens are unaware of this tool designed to protect them from digital frauds and theft.The directive requires manufacturers to complete implementation within 90 days and submit compliance reports within 120 days. For devices already in sales channels, manufacturers are encouraged to push the app through software updates. Sanchar Saathi can be downloaded from both Google Play Store and Apple App Store for users who wish to access its services voluntarily.","India's government has mandated that all smartphones sold in the country must come pre-installed with Sanchar Saathi, a cybersecurity application.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

Elon Musk says AI and robots are the only way out of America’s debt crisis









Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently revealed that the does not invest in stocks in the traditional sense. Speaking in an interview with Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath at the WTF podcast, Musk said, “I don’t really buy stocks… I don’t have a portfolio or anything. I don’t look for things to invest in. I just try to build things. And then there happens to be stock of the company that I built.” Musk stressed on the fact that he is always focused on creating companies and not in investing in others.When Kamath asked Elon Musk that in which companies outside his own ventures he would consider. Replying to this Musk said that certain industries will generate overwhelming economic value in the future. “AI and robotics are gonna be very important,” he explained, later adding “space flight” to the mix.

How this move can help ChatGPT maker OpenAI

What OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier about ads in ChatGPT

“uniquely unsettling to me”

“last resort for us as a business model,”

“not totally against them.”





ChatGPT's free version may soon start showing ads to its users. A report claims that OpenAI has internally started testing ads for the free version of ChatGPT. This shift will mark an end to the completely ad-free experience that the AI startup offers to its users. This is an attempt by OpenAI to make a new revenue stream, much similar to the one fueling Google Search, where ads and promotions of various products influence user purchasing behavior. While the premium plans exist, this move has been about monetising the large free user base and could redefine the economics of the web by integrating commerce directly into the generative AI chatbot.Engineer Tibor Blaho took to the microblogging site X, formerly Twitter, to point out that a beta version of ChatGPT's Android app, version 1.2025.329, contains new code references to anincluding mentions ofand aSharing a screenshot of his findings, Blaho wrote:This suggests that the free version of ChatGPT on Android may start showing ads soon, and once they appear, they will likely show up on the chatbot’s iPhone app as well. But iPhone users can still ask individual questions through Siri, which almost certainly won’t show ads.If Siri can’t answer something, it will switch to ChatGPT. Under Apple’s deal with OpenAI, these Siri-powered ChatGPT answers aren’t used for training the AI, and it’s very likely that ads won’t be shown in these sessions either.This shift could affect the web economy because many people don’t realise that ChatGPT may now understand users better than Google. It could use that information to show personalised ads inside ChatGPT, suggesting products you may want. It is also expected to place ads in search results, similar to Google Search. The leak indicates that ads may appear only in the search area at first, however, this may change over time.ChatGPT is already huge, with about 800 million users per week. That number was only 100 million a week in November 2023 and had risen to about 300 million a week by late 2024.Currently, ChatGPT processes about 2.5 billion prompts a day and India has become the largest user base for it, far outnumbering that of the US.According to Engadget, Altman spoke at a Harvard Business School event last year and said he would try his best to avoid adding ads to AI chats, though he didn’t completely rule out the idea.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that combining ads and AI isand that it’s abut that he’sHowever, the codes discovered recently now suggest that ads may be coming soon.","ChatGPT's free version may soon start showing ads to its users.

Elon Musk says AI and robots are the only way out of America’s debt crisis





He described the US national debt as “insanely high,” warning that interest payments on this debt already exceed major budget lines such as the defence budget.

Musk expressed scepticism about conventional political or fiscal solutions, suggesting they are insufficient to correct the structural debt problem.

He predicted that within about three years, the production of goods and services enabled by AI and robotics could outpace inflation, leading to economic growth strong enough to reduce or neutralise the debt burden.

Musk also argued that this transformation could lead to broader societal changes: less reliance on human labour, increased automation, and a shift toward abundance rather than scarcity.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

Why Elon Musk believes AI and robotics offer a unique path





Historical precedent of technological breakthroughs

Boost to production, efficiency and economic output

Shift from borrowing to value creation

What America’s debt looks like in 2025





The US national debt has reportedly crossed $36–38 trillion, a historically high level.

Interest payments on this debt are rising rapidly, and some analysts note that interest costs alone already exceed spending on major budget categories such as defence.

Traditional fiscal tools spending cuts, tax increases, or deficit controls, are increasingly viewed as politically difficult or economically painful.





Today, as global discussions focus on rising government debt and economic uncertainty, Elon Musk offers a bold vision: he believes artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics can resolve the US national debt crisis within three years. On a recent podcast appearance with Nikhil Kamath, Musk argued that technology-led growth in goods and services could outpace inflation and debt accumulation, potentially reversing America’s fiscal burden. This claim comes amid growing concern over inflation, mounting interest payments on debt, and shrinking budgets for key social and defence programs. With the US national debt crossing historic thresholds, Musk’s statement has sparked debate over whether advanced automation can realistically reshape national economies and whether such a transformation might indeed offer an escape from a spiralling debt spiral.In a recent podcast interview with Nikhil Kamath, Elon Musk laid out his reasoning for why AI and robotics are the only plausible path out of America’s debt crisis.In summary, Musk’s claim hinges on the idea that a surge in productivity and output powered by AI and robotics can fundamentally change the way the economy produces value enough to outpace both inflation and debt accumulation.Musk points out that past shifts, such as electrification, mass production, and the computing revolution, transformed societies by greatly increasing productivity and economic output.He sees AI and robotics as the next wave capable of a similar leap.Under this view, when goods and services can be produced more efficiently and on a larger scale, the total output (the “denominator” in economic terms) grows fast enough to support current debt loads and interest costs, possibly reducing fiscal pressure without major cuts or tax hikes.Musk’s companies, notably those building automated manufacturing, robotics, and advanced AI software, already rely heavily on automation to reduce costs and increase output. He argues that, when scaled across the economy, similar automation could significantly raise national productivity.In effect, widespread adoption of AI could drive down the relative cost of production, increase the supply of goods and services, and allow the economy to grow in real terms rather than nominal, easing debt burdens over time.Instead of addressing debt through austerity or taxation, Musk’s approach reframes the problem as a growth and innovation challenge. If AI can dramatically increase value creation by automating labour, expanding production, and enabling new industries, then revenue generation can outpace debt obligations, making debt more manageable without painful social or fiscal cuts.To understand why Musk’s proposal gains attention, consider these recent economic signals:In this context, Musk argues that only a sharp boost in productivity delivered by AI can realistically restore long-term fiscal balance while avoiding deep social upheaval.","Elon Musk says AI and robots are the only way out of America’s debt crisis.

Telecom ministry's Sanchar Saathi mobile app order sparks surveillance concerns

Apple likely to say 'No', other companies reviewing order

What is Sanchar Saathi app





Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has issued a clarification on the Sanchar Saathi app. The minister said that the cybersecurity app is not mandatory for users. ""The app is completely optional. If you want to delete it, you can. If you don't wish to register, you shouldn’t register and can remove it anytime,"" Scindia told reporters outside the Parliament. The telecom minister added that the app does not enable snooping or call monitoring. ""But not everyone in the country knows that this app exists to protect them from fraud and theft,"" Scindia said.""It is our responsibility to make this app reach everyone. If you want to delete it, then delete it. If you don't want to use it, then don't register it. If you register it, then it will remain active. If you don't register it, then it will remain inactive. For instance, if you don't want to use the app, don't register for it, it will stay dormant, and delete it if you want to,"" Scindia explained. He added that the government's responsibility is to make the app available to everyone, as many citizens are unaware of this tool designed to protect them from digital frauds and theft.The report added that the order further says that for devices already in the supply chain, manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates.Reuters report claimed that the telecom ministry privately asked smartphone makers to preload all new devices with a state-owned cyber security app that cannot be deleted. The Reuters report said that it has seen the government order.According to the Union government, the Sanchar Saathi app helps prevent cyber threats and assists tracking and blocking of lost or stolen phones, helping police to trace devices, while keeping counterfeits out of the black market.The order caused a furore both inside and outside Parliament on Tuesday, with a number of lawmakers accusing the government of introducing an app that would act as a snooping tool. Rahul Gandhi of main opposition Congress Party said he planned to speak about the app in Parliament. The Congress Party has called for a rollback of the mandate. On X (formerly Twitter), KC Venugopal, a top Congress leader, said ""Big Brother cannot watch us. ""According to a Reuters report, Apple does not plan to comply with a mandate to preload its smartphones with a state-owned cyber safety app and will convey its concerns to the ministry. Apple does not plan to comply with the directive and will tell the government it does not follow such mandates anywhere in the world as they raise a host of privacy and security issues for the company's iOS ecosystem, said two of the industry sources who are familiar with Apple's concerns. They declined to be named publicly as the company's strategy is private. ""Its not only like taking a sledgehammer, this is like a double-barrel gun,"" said the first source.Other brands including Samsung are reviewing the order, said a fourth industry source who is familiar with the matter. Samsung did not respond to Reuters queries.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) introduced the Sanchar Saathi mobile app in January 2025. According to telecom department, the app complements the existing Sanchar Saathi portal by providing convenient, on-the-go protection against identity theft, forged KYC, device theft, banking fraud, and other cyber risks. As per DoT, Sanchar Saathi app is mainly designed to help users block and track lost or stolen smartphones across all telecom networks, using a central registry. It also lets them identify, and disconnect, fraudulent mobile connections.One of the world's largest telephone markets, India has more than 1.2 billion subscribers. As per government figures, the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones, including 50,000 in October alone. With more than 5 million downloads since its launch, the app has helped block more than 3.7 million stolen or lost mobile phones, while more than 30 million fraudulent connections have also been terminated.The app is available in Hindi and 21 other regional languages, making it inclusive and accessible across the country.",Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has issued a clarification on the Sanchar Saathi app. The minister said that the cybersecurity app is not mandatory for users.

Google’s position in the AI race



Wall Street takes notice as competitive dynamics shift







Nvidia, the chipset making giant has now downplayed concerns that Google is coming for its dominance in the AI hardware market, even as reports Meta may spend billions on Google’s custom chips. The comments come at a time when competition is increasing in the AI race and a volatile stretch for Nvidia’s stock. In a statement posted on X, Nvidia said, “NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.” The company added: “We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.”The remarks made by Nvidia is followed by a report from The Information highlighting that Meta is in talks with Google to potentially use its chips to power data centers, a move that rattled the investors. Also, the share of Nvidia fell more than 3% following this news.According to The Information, Meta could begin renting TPUs from Google Cloud as early as next year, with purchases for its own data centers potentially starting in 2027.This matters enormously because Meta ranks among Nvidia's largest customers, planning up to $72 billion in AI infrastructure spending this year. For Google to capture even a fraction of that business would represent a seismic shift in the AI hardware market.The deal would also mark Google's expansion beyond its current strategy of using TPUs exclusively in its own data centres, positioning the company in direct competition for the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors.As reported by Business Insider, Google replied by stressing that its commitment to supporting both its own Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Nvidia’s GPUs. “We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs; we are committed to supporting both, as we have for years,” a Google spokesperson said.Recently, Google gained momentum in the AI race after the launch of Gemini 3 and the model also received positive reviews. Unlike many rivals, Google benefits from a “full-stack” advantage, controlling everything from AI research to its cloud infrastructure.The rivalry between Nvidia and Google comes at a time, when the world’s largest company by market capitalisation has faced a turbulent few weeks. The chipmaker reported blockbuster third-quarter earnings, initially calming fears of an AI bubble.

Government’s position







Australia’s plan to impose a ban on social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat for children under 16 is now facing a High Court challenge. As reported by Reuters, a 15-year-old student, Noah Jones has become the face of this opposition. Jones said that the law which is said to come into effect from December 10, 2025 will not protect young people but will instead make the internet more dangerous. Jones, who is co-plaintiff in the case alongside another teenage, believe that the ban would be widely circumvented and push young users into less regulated corners of the internet. “This measure will make the internet less safe for young people,” he argued, stressing that social media is essential for staying connected and sharing ideas, likening it to a modern-day town square.As reported by Reuters, a case has been filed against Communications Minister Anika Wells and eSaftey Commissioner Julie Inman Grant. The case has also drawn support from the Digital Freedom Project, an internet rights groups that claims the ban is an “unfair assault on freedom of speech” and violates the implied constitutional right to freedom of political communication.The group is of the point-of-view that banning the internet access for the young people is not the solution, instead they should be taught how to navigate digital spaces safely.""We should be cutting off the bad things about social media. When kids do things in secret, that's when things can be really harmful,” Jones told Reuters.Jones said social media is essential for staying connected and sharing ideas, likening it to a modern-day town square. ""I have almost all the people in my year on Snapchat. It's a light way of being connected. Most people will get quite separated,"" he said.The government has however vowed to stand firm against the challenge. Communications Minister Wells said the ban is necessary to protect children from harmful content and online predators, insisting that the government will not be intimidated by legal threats or pressure from big tech companies.The law requires platforms to remove all users under 16 or face hefty fines. Supporters say it will shield minors from exploitation and mental health risks, while critics warn it could backfire by isolating young people and limiting their ability to engage in civic discourse. The debate reflects a broader global struggle over how to balance child safety, digital rights, and free expression in the age of social media.","Australia’s plan to impose a ban on social media platforms for children under 16 is now facing a High Court challenge.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Social intelligence gains prominence in AI era

CEO reshapes Microsoft’s culture with 'growth mindset' approach





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized that emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly vital in the workplace as artificial intelligence takes over more technical responsibilities, calling empathy a crucial business skill rather than just a soft skill.During a recent conversation with Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner on the ""MD Meets"" podcast that aired November 29, Nadella stated that leaders cannot succeed with intelligence quotient alone. ""IQ has a place, but it's not the only thing that's needed in the world,"" he said in the interview. ""I've always felt, at least leaders, if you just have IQ without EQ, it's just a waste of IQ.""Nadella added that social intelligence is also becoming key as AI handles more technical tasks. The Microsoft chief executive has consistently maintained that empathy represents an important business capability, not merely a peripheral soft skill.When Döpfner questioned whether the growing importance of empathy influenced Microsoft's decision to implement return-to-office mandates starting early next year, Nadella responded that recognizing the role of human collaboration is even more crucial in the age of AI, describing the workplace as ""the best collaboration tool.""However, he clarified he doesn't want to be overly rigid about office return policies.Nadella has recently restructured Microsoft's leadership team partly to enhance competitiveness in the AI race, with the company pursuing artificial general intelligence through its new superintelligence team.The emphasis on soft skills comes as many workplaces are starting to value problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and creativity as they delegate more technical responsibilities to AI, according to executives and workplace transformation experts.Nadella's leadership philosophy centers on what he calls a ""growth mindset,"" transforming Microsoft's culture from ""know-it-alls"" to ""learn-it-alls"" during his decade-long tenure as CEO. This approach has helped Microsoft achieve significant growth, with its stock climbing almost 20% this year and its market capitalization reaching $3.7 trillion, making it the world's second most valuable company after Nvidia.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella argues that emotional intelligence is essential for business leaders.

Cat Goetze, a tech founder known online as ""CatGPT,"" has turned a personal quest for nostalgia into a six-figure business, banking on a generation’s desire to disconnect. According to a report by CNBC Make It, Goetze’s startup, Physical Phones, generated $120,000 in sales in its first three days after going viral on social media in July 2025. By the end of October, the business had sold over 3,000 units, totaling $280,000 in revenue. The product—a retro-styled handset that looks like a traditional landline but connects to smartphones via Bluetooth—was born out of Goetze’s desire to reduce her own screen time without sacrificing connectivity.Two years ago, Goetze sought to replace her smartphone usage with something ""low-tech."" However, she discovered that installing a true landline in her apartment was both expensive and logistically difficult.""I was kind of just sitting around [thinking] it’d be so cute if we still had landline phones and you could twirl the cord and talk with your friends,"" Goetze told CNBC Make It. ""That just felt nostalgic and chic to me.""Taking matters into her own hands, Goetze ""hijacked"" a thrifted landline phone and engineered it to be Bluetooth compatible.

It’s a David-versus-Goliath victory: Runway CEO







Artificial intelligence (AI) startup Runway has launched its Gen 4.5 model, claiming that its video generation capabilities outperform rival models from industry giants Google and OpenAI in an independent benchmark. Runway, a company that specialises in AI video research and modeling and is backed by SoftBank, says its new model allows users to generate high-definition videos from written prompts, demonstrating a superior grasp of physics, human motion, camera movements and cause-and-effect sequences.According to a report by CNBC, the startup cites independent AI benchmarking and analysis company Artificial Analysis for its bold claim, saying Gen 4.5 immediately secured the top spot on the company's Video Arena leaderboard. The rankings are determined through blind comparisons where users vote for their preferred output without knowing which company generated the video.The results place Google's Veo 3 model in second place, and OpenAI’s Sora 2 Pro model significantly lower in seventh place.Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela framed the achievement as a David-versus-Goliath victory.“We managed to out-compete trillion-dollar companies with a team of 100 people.""You can get to frontiers just by being extremely focused and diligent,"" Valenzuela told CNBC, noting that Gen 4.5 was codenamed ""David"" internally.“It does feel like a very interesting moment in time where the era of efficiency and research is upon us,” Valenzuela said on the shifting landscape.

In a recent episode of the popular podcast People by WTF hosted by Indian entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, Elon Musk shared advice that has quickly gone viral across India. His message, directed towards young Indian entrepreneurs, emphasised the importance of focusing on building useful products and services rather than chasing wealth directly. Musk expressed admiration for creators who genuinely want to contribute something meaningful to society and encouraged founders to build with purpose, resilience and long-term commitment. The podcast sparked wide discussion across social media as many viewers reflected on whether shifting attention from profit to problem-solving could transform India’s fast-growing entrepreneurial landscape and inspire more sustainable innovation across sectors and communities today.During the conversation, Musk said he is a big fan of anyone who wants to build and who wants to create more value than they consume. He encouraged entrepreneurs to focus on solving real problems rather than pursuing rapid financial gain. According to him, when businesses genuinely aim to provide something useful, success naturally follows. The emphasis on meaningful contribution resonated deeply because many new founders feel pressured to grow fast, seek investment early and measure success only by valuation or revenue.Musk’s view suggests that long-term growth depends more on usefulness than hype and that sustainable companies are built by solving needs that truly matter.This perspective reinforces patient innovation by encouraging creators to prioritize authenticity, resilience, thoughtful design, and community impact across every undertaking.Musk’s comments urge Indian entrepreneurs to place value creation at the centre of their strategy. Instead of replicating existing products or following trends simply to seek profit, he encouraged founders to identify gaps in society and build solutions that genuinely improve life for others. Useful products, he suggested, should be the foundation of every venture because they shape trust, create resilience and last longer than businesses based purely on momentum or marketing. The growing pace of India’s digital and industrial development means opportunities are vast. From affordable technology and education to rural services and healthcare systems, providing real utility remains one of the strongest paths to making an impact.Musk also noted that entrepreneurship involves significant sacrifice, long hours and emotional pressure. He explained that success rarely comes instantly and that building something valuable requires patience and willingness to face failure without giving up. Many startups collapse because the desire for quick results overrides perseverance. His advice encourages young builders to stay committed to their vision, work consistently and remain grounded when setbacks appear. Hard work, combined with purpose, becomes the fuel for meaningful growth. Entrepreneurs who endure difficult phases often become the ones who eventually change industries and create progress.Entrepreneurs inspired by Musk’s message can start by observing real issues around them. Identifying everyday challenges within families, workplaces, or communities offers the strongest foundation for innovation. Instead of beginning with fundraising or branding, entrepreneurs can work on developing small prototypes and testing them directly with users. Listening to feedback, improving continuously, and prioritising quality over speed can lead to stable growth. Additionally, choosing long-term thinking helps build businesses that contribute genuine value rather than temporary excitement. Musk’s approach suggests that profits will follow naturally when a solution solves a real problem.The reason Musk’s message is spreading quickly across India is simple. It replaces pressure with purpose. It reminds young founders that meaningful contribution matters more than chasing financial success alone. In a country that is witnessing an explosion of startups and innovation, his advice encourages a mindset shift towards usefulness, resilience and long-term thinking. By focusing on building valuable products and services that help people, entrepreneurs can create lasting change and shape industries for generations. For those dreaming of success, the message is powerful: build something useful, contribute positively, and the results will follow in time.","In a recent episode of the popular podcast People by WTF, Elon Musk shared advice that has quickly gone viral across India.

Lesson learned from COVID



A national challenge







Ford Motor company CEO Jim Farley recently shared his thoughts on America’s labour future. He revealed that the company is struggling to fill around 5,000 skilled-mechanic roles despite offering salaries around $120,000. Now once again, Farley has said that the realm crises facing America is the shortage of trade workers. In an appearance on the Office Hours: Business Edition podcast, Farley issued a warning that the US is dangerously behind countries like China when it comes with building and sustaining essential workforce. Farley didn’t mince words: “We are in deep trouble when you compare us to China,” he said, pointing to the lack of skilled labor across critical sectors. According to him, more than 1 million jobs are currently sitting empty in emergency services, trucking, plumbing, factory work, and other trades.Farley stressed that this shortage is not just about filling jobs, but it is about safeguarding the country’s ability to function in times of crises. He also argued that skilled traders are the backbone of the US economy and national resilience, but still US is failing to invest in training and education to replenish this workforce.Farley’s grandfather who worked on Ford’s assembly line, has also been vocal about the need to rebuild the pipeline for blue collar workers. “Those hardworking jobs made our country what it is,” he said. “We do not have trade schools. We are not investing in educating a next generation… of people like my grandfather who had nothing, who built a middle-class life and a future for his family.”This is the only conviction which led Ford to become the first major automaker to ratify union agreements during recent labour negotiations in both the US and Canada. “I’m so proud of us,” Farley said. “We got rid of the lower tier, paid everyone the same. Now those people have a career at Ford like my grandfather.”Farley also shared his thoughts on how the pandemic exposed the cracks present in the wage system. He said that many workers told him that they were juggling between multiple jobs in order to make the ends meet. In response to this, Ford altogether eliminated its two-tier wage structure and gave employees a clear path to financial stability, which Farley think is important for workforce rebuilding.Farley also emphasised that this not just the problem of Ford. He mentioned that the solution to this lies in public-private cooperation, education reform and cultural respect for manual work. “If we work together like we always have in America… and we get after this with the government, with education… I think we can solve this. But we have a lot of work to do.”","Jim Farley, CEO of Ford Motor Company, said that the US is in trouble when it comes to building and sustaining a skilled workforce.

Elon Musk’s Indian connection

Elon Musk agrees America has benefitted from talented Indians

Musk says there has been a misuse of H1-B visa





Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has now revealed that his son’s middle name Shekar is inspired by a legendary Indian-American physicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, best known for his groundbreaking work on the evolution of stars. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, Musk made this revelation.Speaking at the podcast interview, Musk said, “My partner is half Indian. My son’s middle name is Sekhar, after the famous Indian physicist.” The physicist in question, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics for his theoretical studies on the structure and evolution of stars, including the discovery of the Chandrasekhar limit that determines whether a star becomes a white dwarf or collapses into a black hole.The revelation made by Elon Musk underscores his personal ties to India. Elon Musk’s partner and popular musician Grimes has India heritage. Grimes once revealed that her step-father is India. Grimes once said, “My step dad’s Indian, I had a fire childhood in a half Indian household. Indian culture jives very well with western culture.”Along with this, Musk has also spoken about India’s role and importance in the global technology and energy landscape.Naming his son after Chandrasekhar reflects both a personal and symbolic connection to India’s scientific legacy.Speaking the podcast, Elon Musk also acknowledged that “America has benefitted immensely from talented Indians”, however, noted that “there has been some misuse of the H-1B Program.” Last year, Musk spoke out in defense of immigrants, specifically praising those who have significantly contributed to the US economy. He advocated for immigration of skilled workers, arguing it is essential to fill the nation’s talent gap.When asked “why has that narrative changed of late?” Musk said that “there's different schools of thought.”“And it actually also had like somewhat of a negative selection effect. So, if there's a massive financial incentive to come to the US illegally and get all these government benefits, then you're gonna necessarily create a diffusion gradient for people to come to the US. It's an incentive structure. And so, I think, that obviously made no sense.Musk also highlighted the misuse of the H1-B programme, saying that amid the need for skilled workers, there has been a misuse of the visa system.“My direct observation is that there's always a scarcity of talented people. So, from my standpoint, I'm like, ‘We have a lot of difficulty finding enough talented people to get these difficult tasks done. And so more talented people would be good’,” he said.“But I guess, some companies out there, it's sort of, they're making it more of a cost thing, where it's like, okay, if they can employ someone for a fraction of the cost of an American citizen, then, I guess, these other companies would hire people just to save costs,” Musk added.According to Musk, his companies focus on “trying to get the most talented people in the world. And we pay way above average.”","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has revealed that his son’s middle name is inspired by a legendary Indian-American physicist.

Grokipedia vs Wikipedia

Grokipedia’s content is largely generated or curated by the AI model Grok, whereas Wikipedia is edited and maintained by volunteer humans.

Wikipedia offers open editing, transparent revision history and community governance; Grokipedia currently limits user edits and lacks full transparency on who changed what.

Wikipedia content is freely licensed (“Creative Commons/Free) and uncoupled from commercial interests; Grokipedia is associated with a for-profit venture and uses AI systems that may embed bias.

Wikipedia hosts millions of articles across many languages and thousands of edits daily, whereas Grokipedia launched with under a million entries and is still at v0.1.

Grokipedia’s rocky start









Recently, it was observed that Anthropic’s AI tool was citing Grokipedia which is an AI-powered encyclopaedia launched by Elon Musk inplace of the widely used Wikipedia . This development prompted a question about whether there as a deeper collaboration between Anthropic and Elon Musk’s xAI, leading Musk himself to weigh in on the matter. An Australian data scientist and co-founder of fast.ai Jeremy Howard recently noticed this change while she was using Anthropic’s search API.Howard shared his observation on X, noting: “Is there some agreement between @AnthropicAI and @grok on search now? The Anthropic API today for me started citing Grokipedia sources when using its search tool, even although Wikipedia results are higher in search engines for these queries.” His post quickly drew attention, with many speculating about the reasons behind Anthropic’s apparent preference for Grokipedia over Wikipedia.Elon Musk also reposed to Howard’s post and clarified that Grokipedia is an open source and is also free to use. “ Grokipedia.com is open source and free to be used by anyone with no royalty or even acknowledgement required. We just ask that any mistakes be corrected, so that it becomes more objectively accurate over time,” wrote Musk.Musk also emphasised that the platform urges the users to correct the errors and help in improving accuracy over time, positioning Grokipedia as a collaborative and evolving knowledge base.Key differences between Grokipedia and Wikipedia are:Despite Musk’s claim that Grokipedia will be a “massive improvement” over Wikipedia, early users have flagged factual errors and ideological slants. One entry falsely claimed that former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy took on a major role in DOGE after Musk’s departure, despite Ramaswamy having left months earlier.Grok, the AI chatbot behind Grokipedia, has also faced controversy. In July, it shared antisemitic content, including posts praising Adolf Hitler. xAI later apologized, attributing the incident to a flawed code update.",Anthropic’s AI tool was citing Grokipedia which is an AI-powered encyclopaedia launched by Elon Musk inplace of the widely used Wikipedia.

Musk says DOGE fought against fraud









Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath, in his recent podcast interview, posed multiple questions to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . One of the queries was regarding the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was set up for cost-cutting measures in the government and led by Musk in the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term. Kamath asked, “What did DOGE teach you if you learned one thing?”Musk described his experience with government operations as an “interesting side quest,” detailing how people there were payment inefficiencies. He also highlighted one change that he believes could save the US government hundreds of billions of dollars annually: requiring a national payment code and a comment field with substantive information for every federal payment.“There were massive numbers of payments that were going out with no Congressional payment code, and with nothing in the comment field, which makes auditing the payments impossible,” Musk stated, adding this “trivial seeming change” could save $100 billion, or even $200 billion a year.Musk said that when efforts are made to stop fraudulent and wasteful payments, the entities responsible do not concede. Instead, they leverage sympathetic arguments to defend their funding.Musk recounted instances where he encountered claims that specific funding was essential for “needy people” or “children in Africa.” However, when pressed for verification, the claims fell apart.“We're not going to send the money unless we can talk to the recipients and confirm they will actually get it,” he emphasised.Musk also gave an example of how people used sympathy to take money from the government.“Fraudsters necessarily will come up with a very sympathetic argument. They're not going to say, 'Give us the money for fraud’. It's going to be like the 'Save the Baby Pandas' NGO, which is like, who doesn't want to save the baby pandas? They're adorable,” Musk said, followed by laughter.“But then it turns out no pandas are being saved in this thing. It's just corruption, essentially. And you're like, 'Well, can you send us a picture of the panda?' They're like, 'No.' 'Okay. Well, how do we know it's going to the pandas then?'"" he added.","Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath posed multiple questions to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

The government of India is reportedly mandating smartphone companies to ensure that all their smartphones come with the official cyber security app. According to a report in Reuters, telecom ministry has privately asked smartphone makers to preload all new devices with a state-owned cyber security app that cannot be deleted. The report claims to quote a government order that Reuters says it has seen. The government cyber security app that Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo, OnePlus and other smartphone companies have been told to pre-install is: Sanchar Saathi app.The government order, dated November 28, gives major smartphone companies 90 days to ensure that the government's Sanchar Saathi app is pre-installed on new mobile phones, with a provision that users cannot disable it. For devices already in the supply chain, manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates, the telecom ministry reportedly said in its order. The report says that has not been made public as yet and was sent privately to select companies. The government says that the app helps prevent cyber threats and assists tracking and blocking of lost or stolen phones, helping police to trace devices, while keeping counterfeits out of the black market.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) introduced the Sanchar Saathi mobile app in January 2025. According to telecom department, the citizen-centric tool brings robust security features and fraud-reporting capabilities directly to users’ smartphones. The app complements the existing Sanchar Saathi portal by providing convenient, on-the-go protection against identity theft, forged KYC, device theft, banking fraud, and other cyber risks. Sanchar Saathi app is mainly designed to help users block and track lost or stolen smartphones across all telecom networks, using a central registry. It also lets them identify, and disconnect, fraudulent mobile connections.As per government data, since its launch on January 17, 2025, the Sanchar Saathi mobile app has crossed 50 lakh downloads as on August 2025. Over 37.28 lakh stolen/lost mobile devices have been successfully blocked and more than 22.76 lakh devices have been traced from the Sanchar Saathi LIVE dashboard.One of the world's largest telephone markets, India has more than 1.2 billion subscribers.
