Public execution in Afghanistan: Man sentenced to 'retaliatory punishment' for murder; thousands gather to watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/public-execution-in-afghanistan-man-sentenced-to-retaliatory-punishment-for-murder-thousands-gather-to-watch/articleshow/125720626.cms,"Representative image

International outcry





A convicted murderer was publicly executed at a stadium in eastern Afghanistan, witnesses told AFP on Tuesday, an act condemned as “inhumane” by UN human rights officials.The Supreme Court identified the executed individual as Mangal. Observers reported that a family member of one of the victims made off with three shots, with thousands of people present to witness the event.The court described the execution as a “retaliatory punishment” following an extensive review of the case. “The families of the victims were offered amnesty and peace, but they refused,” the court said.Local resident Mujib Rahman Rahmani suggested the execution could serve as a deterrent, stating, “No one will dare to kill anyone in the future.” Official notices had encouraged public attendance at the event.According to reports, Mangal was among several individuals who attacked a residence in January 2025, resulting in ten fatalities, including three women.Richard Bennett, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Afghanistan, condemned the execution on Tuesday, calling it “inhumane, cruel, and an unusual punishment, contrary to international law.”He urged that such actions “must stop.”Public executions were common during the Taliban’s initial rule from 1996 to 2001, often held in sports venues. This execution marks the 12th public instance since the Taliban regained power in 2021. The previous case, recorded as the 11th, occurred in October in Badghis, with thousands attending, including Taliban officials.Earlier in April, authorities executed four individuals across three provinces simultaneously. The Taliban continue to implement physical punishments, including flogging, for offences such as theft, adultery, and alcohol consumption. All executions are authorised by Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, based in Kandahar.Human rights organisations, including Amnesty International, have criticised Afghanistan’s use of physical and capital punishment. Amnesty’s April annual report highlighted that death sentences in Afghanistan were imposed through proceedings that “did not meet international fair trial standards.”","A convicted murderer was publicly executed at a stadium in eastern Afghanistan, witnesses said.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin’s ex-wife Nicole Shanahan claims Silicon Valley ‘tech wives’ were used to fund hidden agendas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/google-co-founder-sergey-brins-ex-wife-nicole-shanahan-claims-silicon-valley-tech-wives-were-used-to-fund-hidden-agendas/articleshow/125719824.cms,"Nicole Shanahan says Silicon Valley donor circles were conscripted into elite agendas

The Great Reset and why her comments are stirring debate





Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin and a major philanthropist who once wrote nine-figure checks, has accused Silicon Valley’s elite donor circles of unknowingly supporting what she describes as hidden agendas pushed by global networks of NGOs, Hollywood figures and Davos-linked institutions like the World Economic Forum . In a recently shared conversation, Shanahan said many wealthy tech wives, including herself, believed they were funding social good but were instead being steered toward broader ideological projects.Shanahan, who briefly served as RFK Jr.’s running mate in 2024, said these women were used to set the groundwork for what she associates with Klaus Schwab’s Great Reset, a post-pandemic economic and social vision promoted by the World Economic Forum. Klaus Schwab, the economist who founded the WEF in 1971, has long advocated for stronger public and private cooperation to reshape global systems. She claims the women’s philanthropic dollars and social influence were directed through advisory networks without them realising how their contributions were being utilised.According to Shanahan, tech-world philanthropists were plugged into a system of NGO advisors, Hollywood connections and Davos culture that guided donor decisions. She described Silicon Valley’s wealth ecosystem as a very small group of people who socialise together, serve on the same boards and make decisions that have outsized influence.Shanahan argues that these donors were not fully aware of how their philanthropic movements were being leveraged.She claims the women were used to fund groundwork that supported global policy frameworks rather than grassroots needs.Shanahan paints a picture of Silicon Valley spouses overwhelmed by the demands of extreme wealth. Many manage multiple homes, large staffs, strained relationships and high levels of stress. She says some are medicated for anxiety or depression and are too busy to question how their philanthropic guidance is shaped.She believes this emotional and logistical overload made these women more susceptible to being steered. As she describes it, they find meaning through philanthropic work. That was her identity as well, and she says she truly believed she was helping.Reflecting on her own giving, Shanahan says she once believed her donations were uplifting Black and Indigenous communities. But she now claims the opposite happened and argues that conditions deteriorated instead of improving.According to her:Her argument is that the philanthropic model itself is flawed because the structure reinforces problems instead of solving them.One of her strongest assertions is that two themes were repeatedly used to persuade Silicon Valley women to fund certain projects:Shanahan says these issues were emotionally compelling and therefore effective at steering donors toward programs that aligned with the interests of advisers and global institutions.She claims that any pushback was quickly dismissed with climate-related justifications, saying that whenever questioned, the answer was always some version of ""but climate change.""The Great Reset is a real initiative promoted by the World Economic Forum in 2020 as a framework for rethinking global systems after the pandemic. Supporters see it as a roadmap toward sustainability and economic reform. Critics argue that it centralises too much influence in the hands of global institutions.Shanahan positions Silicon Valley philanthropy as unintentionally feeding into this agenda, not through conspiracy but through unexamined donor pipelines and emotional messaging.Her comments are circulating widely because they come from someone who belonged to Silicon Valley’s highest social and financial circles, personally managed massive philanthropic budgets and now argues that the system is broken and has harmed the communities it claimed to help.","Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has accused Silicon Valley’s elite donor circles of unknowingly supporting hidden agendas.

In a move honoring the nation’s unity, President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has directed that seven new mosques in Abu Dhabi be named after the seven Emirates of the UAE. The initiative comes ahead of the 54th Eid Al Etihad celebrations and reflects a vision to strengthen the values of generosity, progress, and national pride across generations.The names of the seven Emirates will be assigned to mosques located in Mohamed bin Zayed City, Abu Dhabi. Collectively, these mosques can accommodate around 6,000 worshippers, offering ample space for community prayers and gatherings. The construction covers approximately 12,000 square metres and is set to open for worshippers in January next year.This initiative was realized through close coordination between the Presidential Court, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs, Endowments and Zakat, and the Department of Municipalities and Transport in Abu Dhabi.Dr. Omar Habtoor Al Darei, Chairman of the General Authority of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, and Zakat, highlighted that the mosques are designed in a modern architectural style that harmoniously blends Islamic art and heritage with contemporary innovation.Each mosque aims to provide worshippers with a peaceful and comfortable environment while maintaining a strong connection to the community.Dr. Al Darei praised the President’s continued support, noting that these mosques not only serve as places of worship but also as symbols of the enduring values of the UAE, inspiring future generations to uphold the nation’s path of generosity and progress.The creation of these mosques reinforces the UAE leadership’s commitment to nurturing faith and community spirit. Beyond their physical presence, the mosques are envisioned as spaces that foster social cohesion, spiritual reflection, and cultural continuity.By naming each mosque after an Emirate, the initiative ties local identity to national unity, offering worshippers a tangible reminder of the country’s collective heritage.","President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has directed that seven new mosques in Abu Dhabi be named after the seven Emirates of the UAE.

How the selection and registration works





New system upgrades and early registration





Quota, oversight, and support









Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season as the Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs (Awqaf) launches its electronic selection process. Starting December 2, 2025, the Hajj and Umrah Affairs Department will guide shortlisted applicants through a digital system designed to make registration smooth, transparent, and efficient. This initiative also gives operators the ability to plan trips effectively, ensuring top quality services for pilgrims.Pilgrims who are shortlisted will receive an SMS notifying them of their approval. Once notified, they have seven days to complete the registration process with one of the 24 accredited Hajj operators through the official website, www.hajj.gov.qa. Missing this deadline will result in automatic cancellation.During registration, applicants are required to pay an advance of QAR 10,000. This is part of the total Hajj cost, not a separate registration fee, and the final price depends on the services chosen, including accommodation and transportation. Pilgrims must also sign an electronic contract selecting their preferred operator through the online system.The advance payment ensures that applicants are serious about performing Hajj.It also helps operators plan their trips carefully, making sure all arrangements are ready for pilgrims’ arrival. Applicants are encouraged to review the services and costs of each operator, as they may vary in terms of residency, hospitality, and transportation.This year, the electronic system comes with a smoother online payment mechanism, allowing pilgrims to pay comfortably according to the prices set by their chosen operator. Building on the success of previous seasons, early registration is now open, giving operators the chance to finalize contracts and organize trips well in advance.These upgrades aim to provide a seamless pilgrimage experience. Pilgrims can focus on performing Hajj in a calm and organized setting while benefiting from high quality services.Qatar’s quota for this season is set at 4,400 pilgrims. The electronic selection process fully respects this allocation and follows established standards. Awqaf is working closely with the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah in Saudi Arabia, along with other relevant authorities, to ensure the pilgrimage runs smoothly and meets the expectations of Qatar’s pilgrims.For any questions about registration, selection, or services, pilgrims can contact the hotline at 132. The ministry emphasized that these coordinated efforts reflect its commitment to providing an organized, transparent, and fulfilling Hajj experience for all pilgrims from Qatar.","Qatar is gearing up to welcome pilgrims for the Hajj 1447 AH season.

‘Looks like the CEO shooter’: 911 call by McDonald's worker played during Luigi Mangione hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/looks-like-the-ceo-shooter-911-call-by-mcdonalds-worker-played-during-luigi-mangione-hearing/articleshow/125707292.cms,"Luigi Mangione Gets 200+ Letters A Day; Some Too Explicit To Read Out Loud





A Manhattan judge on Monday reviewed key evidence in the murder case against Luigi Mangione , including a 911 call from the Altoona, Pennsylvania McDonald’s where he was arrested last year after a dayslong manhunt after he killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both state and federal cases, with federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty.According to Gothamist, prosecutors played the 911 recording in which the McDonald’s manager told a dispatcher the man in the restaurant “looks like the CEO shooter,” adding that customers were “really upset.” Mangione was arrested there on December 9, 2024, five days after Thompson was killed outside the Midtown Hilton in Manhattan.At Monday’s hearing, prosecutors also showed widely circulated surveillance footage of a masked gunman firing at Thompson at close range. Mangione, appearing in court in a grey suit and checkered shirt, watched the footage without visible reaction and took notes, Gothamist reported.His defence team is seeking to toss evidence recovered during his arrest, including a handgun, a loaded magazine and a handwritten notebook found in his backpack.His attorneys argue police conducted an unlawful, warrantless search. Prosecutors say the arrest and search were lawful and that the backpack’s contents tie the 27-year-old to the killing. Much of the same evidence is also being challenged in the federal case.Testimony from a Pennsylvania corrections officer who said Mangione was placed on “constant watch” at SCI-Huntington before extradition because the prison “did not want an ‘Epstein-style’ situation.”The hearing drew unusually large crowds as Mangione’s supporters — some dressed as Nintendo’s Super Mario characters — gathered outside the court holding “Free Luigi” signs and calling for “no death penalty.” A new photo of Mangione from court went viral on social media, echoing the attention he has received since his arrest.The judge in the state case is expected to rule on the suppression issues and could set a trial date in the coming days.","Luigi Mangione, 27, is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026, extending an existing restriction that currently applies only during lesson time.The ministry of education (MOE) announced the new rules on November 30, saying they are intended to curb digital distractions and promote healthier screen habits, reported Gulf news.Under the revised policy, students must store devices in lockers or bags not just during classes, but also through recess, co-curricular activities and remedial sessions. Schools may grant exceptions “where necessary,” the ministry said.Citing research on excessive screen exposure, the MOE noted that “screen use among students has been shown to displace important activities such as sleep, physical activity and social interactions.” The ministry added that reducing in-school device dependence is part of a broader effort to improve student wellbeing.Alongside the new restrictions, default ‘sleep hours’ on government-issued learning devices will shift from 11pm to 10.30pm starting January.Parents who have opted out of after-school limits have been urged to adopt the earlier cutoff at home.The move aligns with a growing global push to limit digital distractions in schools. UNESCO estimates that about 40 per cent of education systems now impose smartphone bans. Australia is set to introduce a nationwide bar on social media use for those under 16 next week, while China’s Zhengzhou district requires parents to justify why a child needs a phone “for pedagogical reasons.”The MOE said schools will work closely with parents and reinforce Cyber Wellness education to help students build healthier online habits.","Singapore will require all secondary school students to keep their smartphones and smartwatches locked away for the entire duration of the school day from January 2026.

Broader visa reforms in 2025





Thinking about retirement abroad? The UAE isn’t just a playground for investors and professionals, it’s also emerging as a smart, tax-friendly destination for retirees. With its 5-year renewable retirement visa, financially stable expatriates aged 55 and above can enjoy long-term residency without needing a job or running a business.But what does it really take to retire here? From minimum savings and property requirements to monthly income thresholds, understanding the costs, and planning wisely, can make the difference between a smooth move and a financial headache. Beyond the numbers, the visa offers clear perks: no income or property tax, access to world-class healthcare, and the freedom to bring your spouse and dependents along for a secure, comfortable lifestyle.Here’s a complete breakdown of the financial requirements, application steps, and benefits of the UAE retirement visa, so you can see if it makes sense for your retirement plans.The UAE’s retirement visa program provides a 5-year renewable residency option for foreign retirees who wish to settle in the country after their working years. The policy is applicable across all emirates, with Dubai offering an additional customized version of the program.It was officially introduced by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security (ICP) in December 2024, as part of a broader federal update to residency and ID regulations aimed at creating more flexible long-term visa pathways.Applicants must meet all of the following base criteria:In addition, applicants must fulfill at least one of the following financial conditions:Special Case (Dubai Only): Dubai residents are eligible with a lower income threshold of AED 15,000 ($4,050) per month.Applicants are also required to submit a bank statement from the past six months to confirm financial eligibility.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security) manages the retirement visa application process through its digital platforms, namely the official ICP website and the UAEICP smart application.The process involves four primary steps through the UAEICP smart application or official website:In addition to federal guidelines, Dubai offers its own retirement visa initiative, tailored to attract global retirees, their spouses, and dependents. It comes with a choice of four financial qualification options, any one of which would make the applicant eligible:This flexibility allows applicants to tailor their approach based on income, assets, or a mix of both. Foreign applicants can apply through the GDRFAD website under the section titled ‘Issuing a residence permit for the retired foreigner’.To complete the application for the UAE Retirement Visa, applicants must provide documents specific to the financial route they are applying under. The documentation ensures the applicant meets eligibility criteria and supports the processing of the visa.Applicants applying through a financial deposit must submit:Applicants applying through regular income must submit:Note: All documents must be valid and clearly support the financial eligibility route chosen by the applicant. Failure to provide complete documentation may result in delays or rejection.While referred to by some as a “free” visa in media reports, the UAE retirement visa does involve multiple fees for processing, medical testing, and administrative services.Total Estimated Range: AED 2,300 to AED 3,800 ($621 to $1,026)These figures highlight that, while the visa is employment-independent, it is not fee-exempt, and applicants should budget accordingly.The retirement visa is more than just a residency document, it’s a cornerstone of the UAE’s broader strategy for global competitiveness and population diversification.The program strongly aligns with the UAE’s Vision 2031, aimed at diversifying national income sources, significantly increasing global talent retention, and transforming the Emirates into a full-spectrum and vibrant destination — not just for careers but also for retirement, investment, and overall holistic quality of life, reinforcing a strategic and inclusive framework that supports long-term enduring opportunities.The retirement visa is part of the UAE’s broader 2025 residency reforms aimed at attracting long-term residents across diverse sectors. Recent additions include the Blue Visa for environmental experts, expanded Golden Visas for teachers, nurses, digital content creators, and luxury yacht owners, and an enhanced Golden Visa for e-sports and gaming professionals. The rollout also features AI-driven processing for faster approvals, reflecting the UAE’s push for a more inclusive and efficient residency framework. These visa updates reinforce the UAE’s goal to attract and support residents at every stage of life.","Retirees aged 55+ can secure a UAE 5-year visa with AED 1 million in savings, property, or income.

Setback to Trump: Appeals court says Alina Habba ‘unlawful’ US attorney; second legal blow in a week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/setback-to-trump-appeals-court-says-alina-habba-unlawful-us-attorney-second-legal-blow-in-a-week/articleshow/125714484.cms,"Maduro Defies Trump With Fierce Oath, Declares Unbreakable Loyalty; ‘No Slaves Peace For Venezuela’





A federal appeals court on Monday ruled that Alina Habba had been serving unlawfully as the US attorney in New Jersey, delivering a major setback to the Trump administration and potentially setting up a fight before the US Supreme Court . The three-judge panel in Philadelphia upheld an earlier district court ruling that the administration’s efforts to keep Habba in the post sidestepped statutory requirements.Habba, who was neither Senate-confirmed nor appointed by district judges - the traditional routes for US attorney appointments - had her authority challenged by defendants in New Jersey. The panel noted that the government’s maneuvers reflected frustration with “legal and political barriers to placing its favored US attorneys in charge,” adding that “the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the US attorney’s office deserve some clarity and stability. ”The ruling leaves uncertain how ongoing matters in New Jersey’s federal courts will proceed. Some grand jury proceedings and criminal cases had already slowed due to the ambiguity over Habba’s status. Neither the justice department nor Habba’s office responded immediately to requests for comment.The lawyers who brought the challenge - Abbe D Lowell, Gerald Krovatin and Norm Eisen - said the decision showed that “President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions.”They pledged to continue contesting what they called “President Trump’s unlawful appointments of purported US attorneys.”The case could become the first of its kind to reach the Supreme Court, though a similar dispute in Virginia involving US attorney Lindsey Halligan may advance quickly. A federal judge there also found Halligan’s appointment unlawful last week, and the justice department plans to appeal.Habba, 41, previously represented Donald Trump in civil matters and was active in his 2024 campaign. She had no criminal law experience when Trump named her to a 120-day interim term. Her permanent nomination stalled due to opposition from New Jersey’s Democratic senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim.In July, district judges declined to extend her tenure and appointed veteran prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace instead - prompting attorney general Pam Bondi to dismiss Grace and reinstate Habba through a series of unusual administrative steps.The appeals court found each of those steps invalid. It rejected the administration’s claim that Habba could automatically ascend to acting US attorney as “first assistant,” and deemed her simultaneous designation as a “special attorney” “plainly prohibited.” The decision affirms a ruling by chief judge Matthew W. Brann, who concluded Habba had lacked authority since July 1.This marks the second major legal blow for Habba and Trump in a week. Days earlier, the 11th circuit upheld nearly $1 million in sanctions imposed on them for filing “frivolous” lawsuits against several Trump critics, including Hillary Clinton and former FBI director James Comey.","Alina Habba was neither Senate-confirmed nor appointed by district judges.

A proposed law by Republican Bernie Moreno could force many US citizens - including Melania Trump and Barron Trump - to choose between their US citizenship and any foreign citizenship they hold. Moreno, an Ohio senator, plans to introduce legislation named the Exclusive Citizenship Act of 2025, which would end dual citizenship by requiring citizens to declare their “exclusive allegiance” to the United States.Moreno, who was born in Colombia but renounced his Colombian citizenship, told Fox News Digital: “One of the greatest honors of my life was when I became an American citizen at 18, the first opportunity I could do so.”He added, “It was an honor to pledge an oath of allegiance to the United States of America and only to the United States of America.” He argued: “Being an American citizen is an honor and a privilege - and if you want to be an American - it’s all or nothing. It’s time to end dual citizenship for good.”According to The Daily Beast, both Melania and Barron Trump - who hold US and Slovenian citizenship - would be directly affected if the bill becomes law.Melania, originally from Slovenia, became a naturalised US citizen in July 2006. Barron reportedly retains Slovenian citizenship via his mother, and holds a Slovenian passport, which would be rendered invalid under Moreno’s plan.Under the proposed law, the US department of state and the department of homeland security would be tasked with identifying citizens holding dual nationality. Such individuals would then have one year to renounce their foreign citizenship - otherwise they would automatically lose US citizenship and be reclassified as non-citizens under immigration law.Critics of the bill say it could uproot lives of Americans who for generations have legally held dual nationality. Supporters argue dual citizenship may pose “conflicts of interest and divided loyalties,” as stated by Moreno.At present, US law allows citizens to hold multiple citizenships without the requirement to renounce any, meaning the new legislation - if passed - would mark a significant shift in US immigration and nationality policy.The move is already drawing attention, especially given its potential impact on members of the current First Family. Debate is likely to intensify should the bill be formally introduced in Congress.","Ohio senator Bernie Moreno plans to introduce legislation to end dual citizenship.

Views diverging from Nikki Haley



No interest in political career, despite viral rise







Nalin Haley, son of former US ambassador and ex–South Carolina governor Nikki Haley , has downplayed claims that he represents Generation Z politically, saying his recent online prominence was unintended and unwanted.Responding on X to a New York Post story about his growing influence among young conservatives, the 24-year-old insisted he has no plans to build a public platform.“Lol I never said I was the voice of GenZ. It was never my intention to get any platform and it still isn’t,” he wrote. “You’re not gonna see me starting some podcast, YouTube channel, streaming service, or any form of monetization. I’ve avoided the media my whole life and still decline 95% of requests.”Haley added that he is speaking out only because he feels “sickened by the destruction of my country and the disrespect towards my fellow Americans, particularly those in my generation.”When asked by a user what his mother thought about his rising attention, he replied, “We don’t talk about politics at all. Yall see Nikki Haley, I just see Mom.”The New York Post story referred to his appearance on Tucker Clarkson's podcast, where Haley said younger conservatives feel economically abandoned - a sentiment he believes helps explain the appeal of politicians like New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani among young voters.“My friends graduated with great degrees from great schools, and a year and a half later, none of them have a job,” he told the paper. “I think [people who voted for Mamdani are] saying the same things. They just have some different ways to fix the problems.”He argued that Republicans must pay closer attention to the concerns of voters in their early 20s: “My issue is that the Democrats are listening to the younger people and it’s time for the Republicans to do the same.”The Post said that Haley holds views notably to the right of his mother, including stricter immigration positions and a more isolationist foreign-policy outlook.He says the generational gap explains their differences: “I’m just from a different generation, so I have different viewpoints than my mom.”Haley, who works in finance in Fort Mill, South Carolina, describes himself as a Christian, populist and nationalist. He has been critical of corporate influence in Republican politics, arguing that young conservatives are turning away from what he calls a “libertarian neoliberal market mindset.”He has also advocated restricting legal immigration, saying, “It makes no sense to have foreign workers come here [while] we actually are not hiring our own kids.”Despite his growing visibility, Haley maintains he has no intention of pursuing public office: “It was never my intention to get any sort of platform.”He believes, however, that the Republican Party must broaden its appeal among young voters who feel economically sidelined: “My hope is that [the party] will help my generation be able to have the same opportunities that the prior generations had.”For now, he says he wants nothing more than a normal life - and to keep political conversations far away from the family dinner table.","Nalin Haley, 24, is the son of former US ambassador and ex-South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.

The India reveal that stole the podcast



The Austin mansion where the Musk tribe grows



Understanding the four branches of the Musk family tree



1) Justine Wilson: the origin chapter



2) Grimes: the sci-fi chapter

3) Shivon Zilis: the neural network chapter



4) Ashley St. Clair: the political chapter



Musk, India, and the worldview behind the children



So how exactly is Shivon Zilis Indian?



The Musk dynasty after the podcast







When Nikhil Kamath sat down with Elon Musk, everyone expected the usual: a little H-1B talk, a little Starlink optimism, a little population-crisis sermon. What nobody anticipated was the moment that detonated across Indian social media. Musk casually acknowledged that one of his children is half-Indian through Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, and the internet declared it the real highlight of the episode.Within hours, the conversation shifted from satellites and semiconductors to Musk’s gene pool, which now includes a tiny but symbolically powerful Indian branch. The memes were instant. The pride was disproportionate. And India, without lifting a diplomatic finger, had found itself woven into the Musk family saga.It helps that Musk’s family tree is not so much a tree as a continent. Four mothers. Fourteen children. A naming style that feels like a collaboration between Greek mythology, computer science, and a baby-name generator that malfunctioned. And a parenting philosophy that treats reproduction as a form of civilisation maintenance. The podcast simply reminded the world that this is no ordinary family, and that India has now entered the story in the most unexpected way.Shivon Zilis has always maintained a calm, almost monastic presence in Musk’s otherwise chaotic narrative. She is an AI researcher, a Neuralink executive, and the mother of four of Musk’s children. What many people had not fully processed until the Kamath podcast resurfaced the fact is that Zilis’s mother is of Indian origin.One offhand remark from Musk, one clip on social media, and India suddenly felt like it had gained a new, unofficial ambassador in the Musk household. Not through politics or policy, but through lineage. Even by Musk’s standards, it was an unintended plot twist.One detail that rarely gets attention is the physical world these children inhabit. Zilis moved into Musk’s vast Austin compound in 2023, a property large enough to raise a small civilisation and quiet enough to stay out of the tabloid circus. Multiple Musk children live there, forming a strange hybrid of family, futuristic commune, and personality cult.If someone pitched this as a Netflix series, it would be described as equal parts Silicon Valley fable and sci-fi domestic drama.Musk’s first marriage brought six children, including twins and triplets. Their story had tragedy, IVF struggles, and a long divorce that shaped Musk’s early years as a parent.This was the era of X, Y, and Tau. A relationship built on art, technology, and surreal naming conventions that eventually unravelled into a messy custody battle.The quietest and most intriguing partnership. Four children. A shared interest in brain-machine interfaces. A mixed Indian-Canadian heritage that the internet has now placed front and centre. A move to the Austin compound that marked the creation of a new household cluster.The most controversial twist. A conservative influencer who revealed she had a child with Musk in 2024. The public reaction was immediate and intense, amplifying the drama already surrounding Musk’s ever-expanding family.During the podcast, Musk repeated his belief that the world’s biggest problem is declining birth rates. He admires India’s demographic strength and insists that civilisation survives only if people have more children.This belief is not theoretical for him. It is operational. He lives it. His fourteen children are not just family. They are an ideology in motion. And the India angle adds an unexpected cultural layer to a man whose personal life already reads like an experiment in futuristic parenting.Her mother is of Indian descent, giving her a mixed heritage that rarely featured in coverage of her work. Zilis is not the flamboyant, festival-posting, diaspora stereotype. She embodies the quieter, intellectual version of Indian ancestry that finds its way into global spaces without making a sound.It is only because Musk mentioned it so casually on Kamath’s show that the world suddenly connected the dots. And India, which never lets a global cultural tie go to waste, adopted the detail with full enthusiasm.The family remains the same. The list of names remains the same. The pace at which children appear probably remains the same.What has changed is the narrative. India now sits inside the Musk family tree, not through a boardroom deal or a Tesla factory, but through the lineage of one woman who built her career around AI.Kamath went in expecting a tech conversation. Musk gave India a genealogical cameo. And the internet, as always, made it larger than life.","Musk casually acknowledged that one of his children is half-Indian through Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis.

Clashes in Manhattan







New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Monday, sharply criticised federal immigration raids, calling them “cruel and inhumane” and arguing they fail to advance public safety. The remarks came after more than a dozen protesters were arrested during a violent confrontation with federal agents in lower Manhattan over the weekend.Speaking to reporters Monday, Mamdani referred to his meeting with the President Donald Trump, and said he had conveyed to him that these raids are doing no good.“When I met the President I made it very clear that these kinds of raids are cruel and inhumane, that they are raids that do nothing to public safety. And that my responsibility is to be the mayor to each and every person that calls this city their home and that includes millions of immigrants of which I'm one,” he said.Mamdani’s comment reflects his campaign promise to defend New York’s immigrant communities against aggressive federal immigration actions. The self-described democratic socialist - born in Uganda and naturalised as a US citizen - is poised to become the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor when he takes oath next month.Mamdani’s remarks came two days after a tense standoff in lower Manhattan where protesters attempted to block federal agents from exiting a garage during an ICE enforcement action, according to law enforcement officials. Demonstrators chanted “ICE out of New York,” locked arms to form a human barrier, and some hurled roadside planters at government vehicles. Officers responded with what appeared to be pepper spray to disperse the crowd, the officials said, reported CNNMore than a dozen people were arrested. Saturday’s confrontation follows a series of protests nationwide over the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and came just weeks after a chaotic ICE raid on Chinatown’s Canal Street.A department of homeland security spokesperson said individuals “dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles” obstructed officers after social media posts “called agitators to ICE’s location.” Publicising federal officers’ movements “puts a target on their backs,” the spokesperson added, warning that “anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted.”","New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani sharply criticised federal immigration raids, calling them “cruel and inhumane” and arguing they fail to advance public safety.

H-1B Controversy Erupts After US Economist Alleges Industrial-Scale Fraud Targeting Indian Visas





The US has been an “immense beneficiary” of talent from India, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said, and voiced strong support for the H1B visa programme, cautioning that shutting it down would “actually be very bad” for America. The US tech billionaire made the remarks in an interview with investor and entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, released Sunday.“Yes, I think America has benefited immensely from talented Indians who have come to America... America has been an immense beneficiary of talent from India,” Musk said.On the H-1B visa , Musk aid, while there has been some misuse of the work visa programme, he strongly believes that it should not be shut down. “It would be accurate to say that... some of the outsourcing companies have gamed the system on the H-1B front. And we need to stop the gaming of the system. “But I’m certainly not in the school of thought that we should shut down the H-1B programme. That’s where some on the right are.

Musk pointed out that under the Joe Biden administration, “it was a total free-for-all, with like no border controls, which, you know, unless you’ve got border controls, you’re not a country”.

US President Donald Trump said on Sunday his administration intends to maintain a pause on asylum decisions for “a long time” after an Afghan national allegedly shot two National Guard members near the White House, killing one of them.When asked to specify how long it would last, President Trump said he had “no time limit” in mind for the measure, which the Department of Homeland Security says is linked to a list of 19 countries already facing US travel restrictions. “We don’t want those people,” Trump continued. “You know why we don’t want them? Because many have been no good, and they shouldn’t be in our country.”The Trump administration issued the pause in the aftermath of the shooting in Washington on November 26, that left 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom dead and another guardsman critically wounded.A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder in connection with the incident.

NEW DELHI: Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Tuesday allowed former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan’s sister, Uzma Khanum, to meet him, breaking weeks of restricted access that had prompted protests by PTI supporters and family members.According to Pakistan news website Dawn, Uzma entered the prison in the afternoon as several PTI workers gathered outside the jail premises demanding transparency about Imran’s condition.The meeting came on a day when PTI had already planned demonstrations outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail to protest what it called unjustified curbs on Imran Khan’s visitation rights. The family and party members had been denied meetings for several weeks despite an earlier Islamabad High Court order permitting twice-weekly visits.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan had filed a contempt petition against the Adiala Jail superintendent and senior officials for allegedly defying the court’s directions. The petition said authorities had repeatedly blocked visits by family, lawyers and PTI leaders since March. Jail officials have maintained that Imran remains in Adiala Jail in good health.The confrontation escalated after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was barred from meeting Imran for the eighth consecutive time, prompting him to lead a sit-in outside the prison.PTI continues to demand clarity on Imran’s health and direct access for his family.Also read: Pakistan: Can Imran Khan meet visitors in jail?

Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel.”Noreen added, “At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries.” She accused police of slapping and dragging other women, calling it “part of a broader and troubling pattern of indiscriminate force used against peacefully protesting citizens over three years.”Rumours around Imran’s well-being surged after unverified Afghan media reports claimed he had died in custody. His son, Kasim Khan, demanded proof of his father’s safety, saying on X that Imran has now spent 845 days in prison and the last six weeks in a death cell without any family contact.Imran Khan has been jailed since August 2023 in multiple cases, and authorities have enforced strict access restrictions for more than a month. PTI alleges these restrictions are being imposed under the influence of an army officer, a claim that authorities have denied.

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers.

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

Imran Khan Isolation Sparks Fury As PTI Claims His Photo Could Transform Pak’s Political Reality

What the rules say about ‘political prisoner’ access





This raises a critical question: what does the jail manual actually say?

Meetings with five people per week, including lawyers and relatives

30 minutes of phone time weekly

Rules that are ‘subjective’





Family’s repeated requests denied









Former Pakistan prime minister and World Cup–winning captain Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years. In recent days, rumours about his health, and even claims that he may have died, have spread widely on social media. His family says they are worried because they have not been allowed to meet him for weeks.The anxiety deepened on Friday when Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan publicly demanded that the government prove the 73-year-old PTI founder is alive.""We demand proof of Imran Khan's life,"" Kasim said in a social media post.For nearly a month, no family member, lawyer or party aide has been allowed to see the former cricketer-turned-politician, fuelling speculation that he may have been harmed inside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been incarcerated for over two years.According to Dawn, while the government maintains that Imran Khan is being given all ""possible facilities"", a senior cabinet member on Friday claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was trying to meet Khan in violation of the jail manual.Information minister Atta Tarar’s remarks triggered a sharp response from the PTI, which insists its court-approved visiting schedule — Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.Dawn reports that visitation and phone calls are tied to a prisoner’s ""good behaviour"", giving the jail superintendent wide discretion.As the newspaper notes: ""Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings.""Current and former prison officials told Dawn that prisoners in Punjab, including political detainees, are allowed:Even condemned prisoners can meet family and lawyers once a week and get the same phone allowance via public call offices inside Adiala Jail.Political prisoners, Dawn adds, are placed in special cells under strict security, with daily medical check-ups mandated to ensure they are healthy.But these rules are not absolute. Their implementation depends heavily on the inmate’s behaviour, making the process ""necessarily subjective"", according to Dawn.Serious charges -- including terrorism or anti-state activities -- can also restrict access.A retired senior prison department officer told Dawn that access to lawyers or relatives ultimately rests with the jail superintendent, who can block meetings or calls if an inmate’s behaviour is deemed ""not good"".Despite court orders and repeated attempts, Imran Khan’s three sisters, PTI members and CM Sohail Afridi have been camping outside Adiala Jail for days, demanding a meeting with him.Kasim Khan said the family has been kept completely in the dark: ""My father has been under arrest for 845 days. For the past six weeks, he has been kept in solitary confinement in a death cell with zero transparency. His sisters have been denied every visit, even with clear court orders allowing access. There have been no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""Calling the situation ""deliberate"", he added: ""This absolute blackout is not a security protocol. Rather it is a deliberate attempt to hide my father's condition and prevent our family from knowing whether he is safe… the Pakistani government and its handlers will be held fully accountable legally, morally and internationally for my father’s safety.""He also appealed to international organisations and human rights groups to intervene urgently.""We demand proof of his life, enforce court ordered access, end this inhumane isolation and call for the release of Pakistan’s most popular political leader who is being held solely for political reasons,"" Kasim said.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years.

Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life.

He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks. Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Kasim Khan claims his father has been kept in a 'death cell with zero transparency' Islamabad refutes rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was 'brutally' assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother.

As Pakistan Halts Afghan Transit, Kabul Boosts India Partnership And Fast-Tracks The Chabahar Route





The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals and only narrowly held back from imposing a complete ban on the Pakistani passport, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.Pakistan’s additional interior secretary Salman Chaudhry informed the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport,” as reported by Dawn.“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” Chaudhry said.Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who chairs the Senate human rights committee, confirmed the interior ministry official’s account in comments to the paper.She said the travel restrictions stemmed from concerns about individuals visiting the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.According to her, the committee was informed that the UAE had largely stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, and that only a limited number had been granted recently, and “after much difficulty”.A Pakistani blue passport is an official travel document reserved for government officials and other eligible personnel, distinguishing it from the standard green passport issued to ordinary citizens.Meanwhile, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi briefed Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday about “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis,” according to a statement from the minister’s office.The statement added that nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, outlining the reforms highlighted by the envoy.Pakistan and the UAE maintain longstanding diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The Gulf nation is among Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the region and a key source of remittances, supported by a sizeable Pakistani workforce residing there.However, Pakistani nationals experienced a surge in visa rejections in early July, prompting interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart.","The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore).“Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council’s Dialogue on the Economy on Wednesday, according to The Express Tribune.Ahmad, who has led the SBP since August 2022, noted that Pakistan’s growth trajectory had been “steadily weakening for decades” — slipping from an average of 3.9 per cent over the past 30 years, to 3.5 per cent in the last two decades, and further down to 3.4 per cent over the past five years.He added that Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending. He urged policymakers and private-sector leaders to move away from short-term fixes and adopt a long-term outlook.Calling the moment an “inflection point,” Ahmad pushed for a shift towards inclusive, sustainable growth, advocating structural reforms and urging businesses to expand their competitiveness by integrating into global value chains, modernising production, and avoiding “shortcuts” for quick profits.Ahmad also highlighted that Pakistan’s external debt nearly doubled from $55 billion to $100 billion between 2015 and 2022 without a corresponding rise in reserves. Since 2022, however, public external debt has remained broadly unchanged while SBP’s reserves have climbed from $2.9 billion to $14.5 billion, aided by $8.4 billion in market purchases during the last fiscal year.His remarks came a day after Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal blamed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s highest unemployment rate in 21 years. Unemployment has risen to 7.1 per cent, while the World Bank estimates 44.7 per cent of Pakistanis now live below the poverty line.","State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore) Ahmad said Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125617122,imgsize-60374,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-current-growth-model-cannot-sustain-250-million-population-says-state-bank-governor.jpg"

A young Pakistani woman, missing for 17 years, has been reunited with her family with the help of facial recognition technology and AI.Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address. “I was lost and crying. A kind woman took me to the Edhi Centre in Islamabad as I couldn’t remember anything,” she said, news agency PTI reported.A few days later, Bilquis Edhi, wife of the late Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation, brought Kiran to the Karachi shelter home, where she grew up under Bilquis’ care. Sabah Faisal Edhi, wife of the current chairperson Faisal Edhi, said repeated attempts to trace Kiran’s parents through visits to Islamabad had failed.Earlier this year, the foundation contacted Nabeel Ahmed, a cybersecurity specialist with the Punjab Safe City Project. Using Kiran’s recent photos and limited childhood details, Nabeel accessed a missing-person police report from 2008 and, with facial recognition and tracking software, successfully located her family.Kiran’s father, Abdul Majeed, a tailor, travelled to Karachi to bring her home. “We searched for years, even published her photo in newspapers, but never found her.We had lost hope,” he said.Kiran expressed mixed emotions on returning home. “I am sad to leave my family members here. I will always be grateful to Bilquis apa and everyone at the shelter for taking such good care of me,” she said.She is the fifth girl from the Edhi shelter whose family has been traced with the foundation now working closely with police and Safe City Projects across Pakistan.","Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address.

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials





Bangladesh’s former prime minister Sheikh Hasina , her sister Sheikh Rehana and Hasina’s niece and British MP Tulip Siddiq were on Monday sentenced to different terms of imprisonment for ‘irregularities’ in allocation of plots under the Purbachal New Town project.Judge Rabiul Alam of Dhaka Special Judge Court-4 pronounced the verdict. Hasina, already sentenced to death for crimes against humanity, was handed five years’ imprisonment, while Rehana got seven years and Tulip Siddiq two years of jail.The court found Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, guilty of misusing her “special influence” as a British politician to coerce Hasina into giving valuable pieces of land to her mother and siblings.Bangladesh does not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (UK), and it is unlikely Siddiq will serve the sentence. The Labour party said it was not recognising the corruption judgment against Siddiq because she was denied the opportunity to a fair legal process in the case.Siddiq had denied the charges, claiming that much of the evidence being presented by prosecutors was forged. She had been put on trial as a Bangladeshi citizen, with a passport and tax ID, even though she said she had not held a Bangladeshi passport since childhood and had never paid taxes there.Siddiq said, “This whole process has been flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end.” “The outcome of this kangaroo court is as predictable as it is unjustified. I hope this so-called ‘verdict’ will be treated with the contempt it deserves. My focus has always been my constituents in Hampstead and Highgate, and I refuse to be distracted by politics of Bangladesh,” the Guardian quoted her as saying.","Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials.

All 17 convicts were fined Tk 1 lakh each, with an additional six months in jail if fines remain unpaid, the state-run BSS news agency reported. The court also imposed a fine of $813 each on Hasina, Rehana, and Siddiq, and ordered the cancellation of the plot allotted to Rehana.According to The Dhaka Tribune, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed six separate cases between January 12 and 14 over alleged irregularities in the allocation of plots under the Purbachal project. The ACC alleged that Hasina, in collusion with senior Rajuk officials, unlawfully secured six plots, each measuring 10 kathas (7,200 sq ft), in the diplomatic zone of Sector 27 for herself, her children Joy and Putul, sister Rehana, niece Siddiq, and other relatives, despite being ineligible under existing regulations. Charges were framed against 29 people, including Hasina’s children Sajeeb Wazed Joy and Saima Wazed Putul, as part of multiple cases filed in January 2025.Tulip Siddiq, who represents Hampstead and Highgate in Britain’s Parliament, had previously denied the allegations, calling the trial “a farce built on ‘fabricated accusations and driven by a clear political vendetta’.” In January, she resigned as economic secretary to the Treasury in Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Cabinet, saying she had been cleared of wrongdoing but stepped down because the issue was becoming “a distraction from the work of the government,” AP quoted.This verdict is one among several against Hasina. Earlier this month, a separate Dhaka court sentenced her to 21 years in jail across three corruption cases over the same Purbachal project, with consecutive seven-year terms and fines of Tk 1 lakh per case. Joy and Putul were also sentenced to five years each in related cases, Dhaka Tribune reported. Mass protests toppled Hasina’s Awami League regime on August 5, 2024, ending her rule after which she took refuge in India. She had earlier been declared a fugitive by a Bangladeshi court. She was also sentenced to death in absentia in November for her role in the violent crackdown on student-led protests, termed the “July Uprising”, and had previously been declared a fugitive.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs adviser Mohammad Touhid Hossain said the interim government expects India to consider Hasina’s extradition “at the earliest possible time,” now that judicial proceedings against her are complete.The country is currently run by an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has announced that the next parliamentary elections will be held in February.","All 17 convicts were fined Tk 1 lakh each, with an additional six months in jail if fines remain unpaid.

Nepal has awarded a contract to a Chinese state-owned security printing firm to produce new banknotes across multiple denominations, a central bank official confirmed on Sunday.Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has selected China Bank Note Printing and Minting Corporation to design, print and supply notes of NRs 50, NRs 500 and NRs 1,000, spokesperson Guru Prasad Paudel told PTI. Under the newly awarded contract, the company must deliver the notes within nine months.Paudel said the NRB provides the technical specifications, after which the Chinese firm prepares a design that must be approved by the central bank before printing begins.Earlier this month, the same Chinese company also received a Letter of Intent to design and print 430 million pieces of the NRs 1,000 denomination.The upcoming NRs 1,000 note will feature seven rhododendrons, Nepal’s national flower, representing the country’s seven provinces. It will also carry the signature of the current governor, Prof Dr Biswo Nath Poudel, appearing for the first time in this banknote series.China Bank Note Printing and Minting Corporation was selected on the basis of the lowest evaluated bid and has previously printed Nepalese notes of Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 100 and Rs 500.Meanwhile, on Thursday, Nepal’s central bank issued new Rs 100 notes carrying a revised national map that includes the Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura regions -- territories that India maintains belong to it. Nepal claims these areas, lying east of the Mahakali river, fall within its borders according to the 1816 Sugauli Treaty.These disputed territories were incorporated into Nepal’s political map in May 2020 by the K P Sharma Oli government, a move later endorsed by Parliament. India had sharply criticised the updated map at the time, calling it a unilateral and unacceptable “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims.NRB officials noted that Nepal’s Rs 1 and Rs 2 coins have already been minted with the revised map for the past two years.","Nepal has awarded a contract to a Chinese state-owned security printing firm to produce new banknotes across multiple denominations.

Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina Faces Fresh Conviction as Court Awards 21-Year Term

'Can issue one-time travel pass to Zia's son'





DHAKA: Bangladesh's request for the extradition of convicted former PM Sheikh Hasina will not affect the broader relationship between Dhaka and New Delhi, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said on Sunday.He emphasised that Dhaka will continue to pursue its priorities, including the Teesta water-sharing agreement and ending ""border killings"", regardless of the extradition issue. ""Since she (Hasina) is convicted, we surely want her extradition to implement the punishment. I do not think other issues will get stuck because of this,"" Hossain said.Hossain reiterated Bangladesh's consistent desire to maintain a good working relationship with India based on mutual respect and shared interests. Though the past govt (Hasina) enjoyed a ""warm"" relationship with India, it failed to resolve longstanding issues such as Teesta water sharing and ""border killings"" in its 15 years in office, he said.On Pakistan, the adviser said bilateral ties had been ""deliberately kept in a bad situation"" for years during the past regime. ""Our decision was to establish normal ties with Pakistan, nothing extraordinary,"" he added.Hossain said the govt can issue a ""one-time"" travel pass within a single day to facilitate BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman's return if he wishes to come back. Rahman has been living in exile in the UK for the past 17 years. He said sthe one-time pass is issued in cases where a person does not have a valid passport or the passport has expired. ""It's for one-time use. It takes only a day to issue such a pass.""","Foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said Dhaka will continue to pursue its priorities, including the Teesta water-sharing agreement and ending ""border killings"" He reiterated Bangladesh's consistent desire to maintain a good working relationship with India based on mutual respect and shared interests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125683233,imgsize-959576,width-400,resizemode-4/sheikh-hasina-ani.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh’s foreign affairs adviser, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, on Sunday said that the interim government expects extradition of former Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina by India ""at the earliest possible time,"" following her conviction for “crimes against humanity” during last year’s student-led protests, which led to her resignation and exile.“I think our (bilateral) relations won’t (be) stuck on one issue alone. However, since Hasina is now a declared convict, we expect her repatriation at the earliest possible time,” Hossain told reporters in Dhaka.The former prime minister was sentenced to death in absentia on November 17 by a special tribunal over her government’s crackdown on the student-led movement, termed the “July Uprising.” The protests toppled Hasina’s Awami League regime on August 5, 2024, after which she took refuge in India. She had earlier been declared a fugitive by a Bangladeshi court.When asked about ties with New Delhi under the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government, Hossain said, “India needs some time to adjust to the new realities,” but added that he was hopeful the two countries would see “better ties.”“We would like to have better working relations with India based on interest,” he remarked.Last week, Bangladesh’s foreign office sent an “official letter” seeking the extradition of the 78-year-old leader of the banned Awami League, following the tribunal’s verdict. According to Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi, the request is being “examined.”Dhaka had previously sent a note verbale in December last year seeking Hasina’s extradition.","Bangladesh’s foreign affairs adviser, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, on Sunday said that the interim government expects extradition of former Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina by India.
