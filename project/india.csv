Prime Minister’s Office new complex to be called 'Seva Teerth',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prime-ministers-office-new-complex-to-be-called-seva-teerth/articleshow/125720910.cms,"NEW DELHI: Meant to reflect the spirit of service rather than ‘power’, the new complex housing the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) shall be called ‘Seva Teerth’ (service pilgrimage), as per officials.Earlier called ‘Executive Enclave’ under the Central Visa Redevelopment project, Seva Teerth right now is in the final stages of completion. The Executive Enclave was meant to house the PMO, besides offices of the Cabinet secretariat, National Security Council Secretariat and India House, which will serve as a venue for high-level talks with visiting dignitaries.Seva Teerth shall be “a workplace designed to reflect the spirit of service and where national priorities take shape,” officials said and added that the choice of name is part of a quiet but profound shift taking place in the country’s public institutions.For instance, only last week, the home ministry wrote to the states and Union territories to rename governor’s houses as ‘Lok Bhavan’ or ‘Lok Niwas’ instead of ‘Raj Bhavan’ as the latter ‘smacks of colonialism’. Several states/UTs have already implemented the directive.Officials said the renaming of ‘Rajpath’ as ‘Kartavya Path’ and PM’s residence as 7, Lok Kalyan Marg instead of 7, Race Course Road, reflect the PM’s focus on changing the orientation of bureaucracy to ‘seva’ (service).The nomenclature ‘Lok Kalyan Marg’ conveys welfare, not exclusivity and is a reminder of the responsibility that lies ahead for every elected govt.“The idea of governance is moving from ‘satta’ (power) to ‘seva’ (service) and from authority to responsibility, they said, adding that the change is not just administrative, but cultural and moral,” said an officer.They added that the spaces of governance, under PM Modi, have been reshaped to lay stress on ‘kartavya’ (duty) and transparency.For instance, the Central Secretariat is now known as Kartavya Bhavan, a vast administrative hub built around the idea that public service is a commitment.“The change in nomenclature marks a deeper ideological transition and shift in mindset....Today, govt officials must speak the language of seva, kartavya and citizen-first governance,” said an officer.","The new complex housing the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) shall be called ‘Seva Teerth’ (service pilgrimage), as per officials.

Sanchar Saathi App Optional Says Centre Amid Fierce Pegasus-Like Snooping Charges and Privacy Debate

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday hit back at the Congress after the opposition accused the government of infringing on citizens’ privacy by directing smartphone makers to preload the Sanchar Saathi app on new devices.Taking a jibe at the Congress, BJP MP and national spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “I know who will delete it… 'Chor ki daadhi mein tinka' (a guilty conscience needs no accuser)""He also made a veiled reference to the National Herald case, in which Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are accused. “You know very well who they are. An FIR has also been filed against them. They have swindled Rs 5,000 crore. At present, they are out on bail,” he told reporters at the BJP headquarters, as reported by PTI.Defending the app, Patra said it is designed to protect users from fraud and crime, not to monitor them, and emphasised that people are free to remove it from their phones if they do not wish to use it.“The app cannot read your messages. It cannot listen to your calls, incoming or outgoing. Sanchar Saathi cannot reach or breach your personal data.” He added that the app helps provide security, check fraud, track stolen mobile phones, and return them to their owners.Minister of communications Jyotiraditya Scindia also,clarified that the app will remain dormant unless users register on it, and can be deleted at any time.Congress has alleged that the directive reflects a “dictatorial” approach, calling Sanchar Saathi a “snooping app” and demanding that the move be withdrawn. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the government of trying to “strangulate the voice of the people”.Responding sharply, Patra said, ""Mr Kharge, it is not meant to strangulate people's voice but to secure their voice, and their mobile phones, without which life is difficult today. We need to secure the device. That is why the government has brought this app.”“You keep on spreading misinformation. But people know how to move on,” he added, as quoted by PTI.","BJP hit back at the Congress after the opposition accused the government of infringing on citizens’ privacy.

Capt Shubhanshu Shares What India Can Learn from ISS Successes

When you look back at your time on the ISS, what moment best captured what the station was meant to achieve?

As the ISS nears retirement, what key lessons should India apply when planning future partnerships?

As India plans a long-term presence in low-Earth orbit, what design or mission principles from the ISS would you keep, revise, or discard?

Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla ’s (Shux) 20-day mission to the International Space Station earlier this year gave India a rare, first-hand view into how the world’s most complex engineering project functions on an ordinary day—and how it copes when things are not ordinary at all. As India prepares for a sustained human presence in low-Earth orbit through the Bharatiya Antariksh Station, Shukla’s reflections offer a grounded account of what the ISS achieved, where it stumbled, and how India should shape its own long-term strategy.In this exclusive interview to TOI, Shux speaks about the moments that defined his time on the station, the value of international collaboration, and the design philosophy that India could adopt for missions in the coming decades.The International Space Station remains one of humanity’s most dazzling examples of what happens when engineering ambition meets international cooperation, and miraculously, everyone agrees on the same orbit. Conceived in an era when floppy disks were still in fashion and the internet sounded like a dial-up flute, the ISS was built to push the boundaries of science in microgravity, test systems essential for future deep-space missions, and serve as a beacon of peaceful collaboration between nations that otherwise rarely agree on anything terrestrial.Construction of this orbital leviathan began in 1998 and reached completion in 2011. To assemble it, humanity performed a kind of celestial Lego project that required more than 1,000 hours of spacewalks and more than 40 Space Shuttle flights. The result? The largest continuously inhabited laboratory off the planet, a structure the size of a football field hurtling around Earth at 28,000 km/h, completing a lap every 90 minutes.During my own mission aboard the ISS, the station felt exactly like the global village it was designed to be. We had 11 crew members representing six nationalities, a small floating model of the United Nations , minus the speeches and with better views. Over the course of our 20-day stay, we conducted more than 60 scientific experiments spanning biology, materials science, human physiology, and space technology. We also carried out STEM demonstrations that connected us with students across the world, sparking curiosity, answering wide-eyed questions, and hopefully inspiring the next generation of explorers, engineers, and dreamers.Looking back, those 20 days perfectly captured the essence of what the ISS set out to achieve. For a machine conceived with 1990s technology, when the most futuristic thing on Earth was a Nokia phone, to not only remain relevant but to continue fulfilling and expanding its mission objectives is extraordinary. The station does not just orbit Earth; it orbits the idea that cooperation, curiosity, and courage can build something remarkable, even 400 kilometres above our heads.Working with crew members from different nationalities reaffirmed something fundamental about space exploration: at its core, it is a profoundly collaborative human endeavour. Space does not care about passports, accents, or geopolitical boundaries. Up there, the only border you notice is the thin blue line of Earth’s atmosphere.During my training for this mission, I found myself hopping across continents more frequently than airline safety videos. From the meticulous engineers in Japan, to the precision-driven teams in Europe, to the seasoned experts in the United States, and the ever-innovative minds in India, each group brought its own culture, expertise, and philosophy to the table. It was like assembling a global orchestra where every instrument mattered, and the symphony was a successful human spaceflight.Before this mission, I knew conceptually that space operations required international coordination. But seeing it firsthand—the late-night calls across time zones, the joint simulations, the integrated training programmes, and the sheer number of people quietly working behind the scenes—made me appreciate the astonishing complexity of sending even one human to space. A single crewed mission represents thousands of hours of planning, countless technical discussions, and the collective will of teams who might never meet but still trust one another implicitly.Beyond accomplishing scientific and operational goals, this collaboration builds something equally important: relationships and trust among people from vastly different cultures and backgrounds. In space, camaraderie is not optional; it is oxygen for the mission. You quickly learn that no matter where someone comes from, if they work in human spaceflight, they speak a common language: space.As we continue advancing on our journey in human space exploration, it is vital that we hold on to this foundational principle. The power of collaboration is not just a sentiment; it is the engine that drives progress. Space has always transcended boundaries, and the work we do should honour that spirit. The only way humanity will reach farther into the cosmos is by going there together.The first module of the International Space Station, the Russian-built Zarya, appropriately named “Dawn”, launched in 1998, marking the beginning of humanity’s most ambitious construction project not on Earth. Over the next 13 years, we assembled this orbital behemoth piece by piece, like a cosmic IKEA kit, except the manual was 10,000 pages long and required spacewalks instead of Allen keys.One of the ISS’s greatest design triumphs was its modular architecture. This was not just clever; it was visionary. The modular approach meant components, scientific racks, power systems, and entire habitable modules could be added, upgraded, or even replaced long after launch. Several of the station’s capabilities today, from advanced biology labs to new solar arrays, were not on the drawing board in the 1990s. Yet the structure welcomed them gracefully, proving its resilience.Another stroke of genius was the strict standardisation of interfaces and protocols. Despite contributions from different space agencies—Nasa, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA—each with its own engineering philosophy, the requirement was simple: any module joining the ISS had to integrate seamlessly with the command-and-control backbone. This ensured that a Japanese experiment rack, a European robotic arm, and an American airlock could all operate in harmony.Equally important was the flexibility for on-orbit maintenance and upgrades. Astronauts often replaced hardware, rerouted cables, installed new instruments, and even deployed new solar arrays. When you build for decades of use, you cannot predict every challenge, so the ISS needed enough adaptability to absorb surprises.That said, the ISS was not designed to be fully future-proof. Technology has moved fast in the last two decades, and modern ISS interiors sometimes look like an enthusiastic octopus let loose with a box of cables. It is high-functioning chaos.As we look ahead, this is the lesson we must carry forward: whatever we design today must be able to absorb the technology of tomorrow.As the ISS approaches its well-earned retirement after more than two decades in orbit, it leaves behind a legacy and a treasure trove of lessons. My time aboard crystallised one truth: before building a space station, you must begin with a sharply defined question—what is it for?Is it a research laboratory? A technology testbed? A stepping stone to the Moon? A commercial outpost? A training ground? The purpose shapes everything that follows.The ISS has also shown the power of collaboration. At a time when nations often disagree on Earth, the station has remained a counterexample, an engineering handshake orbiting above geopolitics. It is still the only structure where multiple countries can send astronauts, run experiments, and access an environment otherwise out of reach. India has been a proud beneficiary of this openness.But the ISS also teaches caution: mismatched priorities, slow adaptation to emerging technologies, and design decisions frozen in the 1990s reveal pitfalls to avoid.Going forward, the challenge is to distil the ISS story into a blueprint for the next chapter of human presence in space. Embedded in its cables and maintenance logs are lessons on what must be done, what must never be done again, and what must be done better. The ISS is not merely retiring; it is passing the torch.The philosophy of modularity has been one of the ISS’s greatest gifts to space engineering. In microgravity, “weight” loses its meaning, and you can launch components separately, even years apart, and assemble them like an orbital jigsaw. But modularity works only if you treat construction as a long-term strategy, a roadmap spanning decades.Flexibility is the other key lesson. Space teaches you quickly that no plan survives first contact with reality. The ISS construction phase was a masterclass in adapting to hardware mismatches, alignment quirks, and surprises delivered by orbital mechanics. The design must have elasticity to absorb new insights and evolving technologies.A station is not just modules; it is an ecosystem. The Earth-based infrastructure—mission control, simulators, life-support testbeds, logistics chains—matters as much as the hardware in orbit. Astronauts need operational flexibility too. They become builders, plumbers, electricians, scientists, and troubleshooters.Design follows objectives. Before drawing the first bolt pattern or finalising an airlock diameter, the mission’s purpose must be clear.As India prepares for the Bharatiya Antariksh Station, we are at a pivotal moment. The insights from decades of ISS operations—its triumphs, surprises, and even its cluttered cable aesthetics—are guiding our approach. We now have the opportunity to design a next-generation station informed by a quarter-century of real orbital experience.","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla’s 20-day mission to the International Space Station earlier this year gave India a rare, first-hand view into how the world's most complex engineering project functions.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday renewed its allegations that its relief operations for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka were being “hampered by lack of cooperation” from India, claiming that permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.“India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face delays for over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a post on X.It added that the “partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief Mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”Shortly after, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them “ridiculous” and “yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.”He clarified that the request for overflight clearance for the Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian aid was received by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad around 1:00 PM on December 1, 2025. “Given the urgency of the humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted overflight permission as per the proposed itinerary at 5:30 PM on December 1, 2025,” he said, in an official statement.Officials also dismissed reports in the Pakistani media claiming India had not granted overflight permission as “fake”. “Pakistani media, as usual, is indulging in propaganda and peddling fake news. These allegations are baseless and misleading. All requests for overflight or transit are processed strictly in accordance with established procedures and international norms,” one of the people said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka faced criticism online after sharing images of the relief materials sent to the flood-hit country.In a post on X Tuesday, the High Commission uploaded photos showing stacks of packaged supplies, stating: “Relief packages from Pakistan have been successfully delivered to assist our brothers and sisters affected by the recent floods in Sri Lanka, which signifies our unwavering solidarity.” However, netizens quickly noticed what appeared to be expiry dates of October 2024 printed on some of the packages.Sri Lanka has been grappling with widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, leaving several districts isolated and severely straining the country’s disaster-response capacity. India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu to assist Sri Lanka in its recovery efforts.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed at least 410 deaths and 336 missing as of Tuesday morning due to the catastrophic floods and landslides caused by extreme weather conditions since November 16.","Pakistan claims permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.

NEW DELHI: An agreement has been reached between parliamentarians to run the House ""smoothly"" after the government gave in to the opposition's demand to hold a discussion on the ongoing pan-India special intensive revision of electoral rolls.After two days of chaos and disruptions, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held a Business Advisory Committee meeting with floor leaders, where it was decided that a 10-hour-long discussion on electoral reforms will be held in the Lower House of Parliament on December 9 and 10.Birla also decided that the discussion on the 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram will take place from 12 noon on Monday, and the discussion on election reforms from 12 noon on Tuesday.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju informed about the decisions taken at the all-party meeting.""During the All Party Meeting chaired by Hon'ble Speaker Lok Sabha today, it has been decided to hold discussion in Lok Sabha on the 150th Anniversary of National Song 'Vande Mataram' from 12 noon on Monday, 8th Dec, and discussion on Election Reforms from 12 noon on Tuesday, 9th Dec,"" Rijiju said in a post on X.Further, Rijiju explained that SIR is an administrative matter of the Election Commission, which is why the Parliament had to widen the scope of the discussion.""Election Commission reform is a larger issue which is conducted by the Govt and discussed in the Parliament. Parliament makes laws. So, for bigger reforms in the Election Commission and Election process, Parliament takes up all the matters. SIR is an administrative matter which was decided by the Election Commission of India,"" Rijiju said.""That is why, I had stated that if at all we have to discuss about the Election Commission and its role, then we have to widen the scope, you can't just pick up a matter which is administrative in nature, conducted by the Election Commission of India without any direction or consultation from the Govt. Since the matter has been settled by coming into an agreement for discussion and the time and the date have been finalised, I look forward to a very constructive and engaging discussion,"" he added.Rijiju had earlier indicated that a solution to the impasse was near, saying the government is ready for discussion on electoral reforms.The decision comes after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day amid persistent sloganeering by opposition MPs demanding a discussion on the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of voter lists in 12 states and Union Territories.Meanwhile, speaking in the Rajya Sabha on the opposition's protest over SIR, Rijiju had earlier said, ""Government is ready for discussion on electoral reforms.

Why December still feels special for students

December has finally arrived, bringing with it the stretch students across the country look forward to all year, winter breaks, Christmas celebrations and the gentle slowing down that marks the end of the academic calendar. After a busy November filled with examinations in many states, schools are now shifting into a lighter schedule as temperatures begin to drop and year-end activities take over.Unlike summer holidays, December breaks don’t follow a uniform pattern across India. Each state, and often each school, sets its own calendar depending on the weather and institutional policies. But there is one common trend: the second half of December typically offers the longest cluster of holidays for schoolchildren before the new year begins.Schools across several northern and central states are expected to go on winter break sometime between December 20 and December 24, with most reopening only in the first week of January. This period usually covers Christmas, New Year’s Eve and the coldest days of the season.Even in states without long winter breaks, certain days will be observed as holidays across most schools:Some schools also club these festive holidays with year-end events, annual functions or cultural programmes, adding to the excitement of the month.December is more than just a month of holidays, it marks a much-needed pause in the school year. The weather encourages a slower pace, families plan outings and reunions, and students get a short but meaningful break before the academic race picks up again in January.Even for schools, this period is valuable: campuses use the downtime for repairs, planning sessions and preparations for final-term activities.","Schools across several northern and central states are expected to go on winter break sometime between December 20 and December 24.

NEW DELHI: The family feud over industrialist Sunjay Kapur's Rs 30,000-crore estate got messier on Monday after his mother Rani Kapur joined forces with his ex-wife Karisma Kapoor in questioning the veracity of his will.Rani submitted before Justice Jyoti Singh of Delhi high court that instead of grieving Sunjay's death after accidentally swallowing a bee while playing polo in the UK on June 12, his wife Priya did everything to take control of his assets, including allegedly ""massive concealment"".Her counsel claimed she was never informed about her son's will, pointing out that it was strange that the document does not even mention her despite Sunjay publicly acknowledging that he got everything from her.""He (Sunjay) would have at least mentioned in the will that he did not want to give anything to his mother,"" Rani's lawyer Vaibhav Gaggar said. ""There is not even a whisper about the mother in the will. She has no ownership in the company built by her husband, which was exclusively left to her.""According to the petition, Sunjay and Priya had a rocky marriage since May 2023, marked by constant fights. ""It is highly unlikely that Sunjay would make Priya the sole beneficiary of his personal estate,"" Rani's lawyer said, also pointing out that the deceased had ""a deep bond with and equal affection for all his children, his mother, and other members of the Kapur family"".Priya also stands accused of omitting assets belonging to the deceased in the list submitted to court, including paintings, bank balances, mutual funds, life insurance, rental income, and watches.Justice Singh will next hear the case on Dec 3. Sunjay Kapur's children with Karisma have already sought an interim injunction to restrain Priya from alienating them from their father's assets, while questioning the authenticity of the will.","Rani Kapur claims she was never informed about her son's will.

CHENNAI: Cyclone Ditwah, which weakened into a deep depression over Bay of Bengal on a breezy Sunday evening, surprised residents on Monday by unleashing one of the wettest mornings of the season.The cyclone, stripped of much of its cloud cover on Sunday, moved northward through the Bay of Bengal. It staged a resurgence overnight, amassing moisture. Drifting slowly northward at 5km/h and edging closer to the coast, the weather system thickened cloud cover over city and suburbs, setting off steady prolonged showers from 5am. It dumped torrents over some parts of north Chennai and neighbouring districts Low-lying areas were flooded, children walked to school drenched, and traffic came to a crawl in most parts of the city. Around 10am, when most people were dodging potholes in traffic bottlenecks, India Meteorological Department reinstated an orange (very heavy rain) alert for the city and a red (extremely heavy rain) alert for Tiruvallur.Between 8.30am and 7.30pm, the city recorded “moderate” rainfall of 10cm, though it was heavy in some parts of North Chennai. Nungambakkam recorded 9.45cm, and Meenambakkam recorded 6.2cm. Ennore topped GCC records with 13cm of rain from 8:30am to 2pm, while Parry’s Corner, Ice House, Madhavaram, Saligramam, and Vadapalani each surpassed 10cm.On Sunday evening, when the cyclone weakened and the city was relatively dry, IMD withdrew the alert for Chennai to yellow (heavy rain) and Tiruvallur to orange. On Monday, weathermen said the system was likely to linger 30km-40km offshore along the coast and forecast heavy rain on Tuesday in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, and Chengalpet.Cyclone Ditwah’s path, however, continued to be a topic of debate. While IMD said the system would fade into a depression and cross land near Nellore early on Tuesday, independent forecasters said there would be scattered bursts in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengalpet, and Kancheepuram. Blogger Pradeep John said he expected the clouds to regain as long as it was close to city coast. “The depression is going to stay for the next 36 hours near Chennai itself,” he said. Ditwah is neither able to move west nor east, he said. If this westerly trough influence moves away on Wednesday, then the cyclone will move west into TN or south AP coast into the land as a weakened cyclone, he said.","Cyclone Ditwah dumped torrents over some parts of north Chennai and neighbouring districts.

In the predatory world of American artificial intelligence, where top engineers command salaries in the millions and signing bonuses rival small fortunes, Apple Inc has taken a big bite out of Microsoft and Google The iPhone giant on Monday announced the hiring of Amar Subramanya, a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft, as its new vice president of artificial intelligence, in an effort to catch up with rivals who have sped ahead. Subramanya steps into a role vacated by the retiring John Giannandrea, inheriting oversight of Apple's foundation models, machine learning research, and AI safety teams amid a high-stakes push to salvage its lagging AI ambitions.Subramanya's whirlwind journey—from Alphabet's Mountain View labs, where he helmed engineering for the Gemini AI assistant, to Microsoft's Redmond headquarters for a five-month co-piloting stint as corporate vice president of AI, and now to sickly Siri at Apple's Cupertino campus—epitomizes the escalating talent war gripping Silicon Valley and beyond.With Microsoft poaching over 20 researchers from Google's DeepMind unit earlier this year, including Subramanya in July, and now Apple counter-recruiting from its rivals, the US AI ecosystem has become a revolving door of elite minds, many of them immigrants like Subramanya.The migration isn't just about prestige; it's a battle for the intellectual capital needed to build the next generation of intelligent machines, as companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic lure defectors with million dollar windfalls, even as MAGA myopics mope about “slave labor” and “code coolies” from India and wallow in toxic gibes on X.At 46, Subramanya arrives with impeccable credentials tailored to Apple's pain points. After earning a BE in electrical, electronics, and communications engineering from Bangalore University in 2001, he completed his PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle in 2009 with a dissertation on semi-supervised learning and graphical models, innovative techniques for training AI systems with limited labeled data — now a boon for privacy-obsessed Apple, which shuns vast user-data troves in favor of synthetic and licensed datasets.Subramanya's graduate work also extended to practical applications in speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and human activity analysis. As a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research, he tackled multi-sensory fusion for robust speech systems and speaker verification, earning a prestigious Microsoft Research Graduate Fellowship in 2007. This early exposure to Big Tech's labs foreshadowed his career, blending theory with deployment. His scholarly output includes the influential book Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning (co-authored with Partha Pratim Talukdar), a staple in machine learning curricula. His academic papers span entity resolution, multilingual Natural Language Processing, cross-document coreference, and audio-visual speech enhancement, underscoring his focus on scalable, multimodal systems.These foundations propelled Subramanya's 16-year Google tenure, starting around 2009 in research roles that evolved into engineering leadership. By 2023, he was head of engineering for Gemini, Google's multimodal powerhouse boasting up to 1.2 trillion parameters. Under his watch, teams of over 100 bridged experimental prototypes to production, integrating text, image, and video processing into Search, YouTube, and Android.Subramanya's pivot to Microsoft in July 2025 – along with a score of gearheads including engineering lead Sonal Gupta – was a cultural reset. In a LinkedIn post that raised plenty of eyebrows, he praised the software giant's ""refreshingly low-ego yet bursting with ambition"" ethos, throwing shade at Google's high-pressure environment. As corporate VP of AI, he contributed to foundation models powering Copilot, the enterprise chatbot embedded in Office and Azure.Both Microsoft and Google are led by Indian-Americans – Satya Nadella and Sundar Picha- – but Subramanya’s stint outside Seattle lasted less than six months before Tim Cook lured him back to Silicon Valley.For Apple, reeling from AI stumbles, Subramanya is a strategic antidote. The company's Apple Intelligence suite, unveiled in October 2024, has faltered: notification summaries spawned fabricated headlines, from false reports of a suspect's suicide to premature sports victories to Netanyahu’s arrest, drawing ire and lawsuits. Siri's promised overhaul—touted for contextual awareness and app control—languished after internal tests flopped, delaying rollout to spring 2026.Giannandrea, like Subramanya a Google import who once led Machine Intelligence, is said to have fostered research but struggled with product delivery. His 2024 paper on ""large-reasoning models"" critiqued AI's simulated cognition, yet Apple's outputs lagged. Now, with Giannandrea advising until spring, Subramanya will report to software SVP Craig Federighi, tasked with accelerating a 1-trillion-parameter in-house model while leaning on Apple’s upcoming $1 billion licensing deal with Gemini to revive Siri – delicious irony in the Apple-Google feud spanning maps to mobile.","Amar Subramanya is a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft.

The figure included Rs 26,645 crore in principal and Rs 31,437 crore in accumulated interest as of October 31, 2025.The ministry said that a total of 15 individuals, including Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi , have been declared Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEOs) under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018, of which nine are linked to major financial frauds involving public sector banks.The government Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines-related accounts show one of the largest exposures, with the State Bank of India reporting Rs 6,848.28 crore in principal dues, which rise to Rs 11,960.05 crore after interest. Multiple other PSU banks also report unpaid amounts linked to him.Nirav Modi, through various entities including Firestar and diamond group companies, owes more than Rs 7,800 crore in principal alone.

IITs bar from placement drive 20+ companies that rescinded offers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iits-bar-from-placement-drive-20-companies-that-rescinded-offers/articleshow/125706903.cms,"An IIT professor said the institutes have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by Centre under Viksit Bharat scheme

Also read:

MUMBAI: Even as the placement season began across the premier IITs on Monday, more than 20 companies were banned from participating this year. These firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year, some even as late as June or July this year, at the time of joining. Since many IITs do not allow students with existing offers to sit for further interviews, such late withdrawals not only jeopardised career prospects but also affected students’ mental well-being, said officials. IITs, therefore, unanimously decided to ban these companies from the current placement cycle. IITs tried helping the concerned students despite the time lapse.The list of banned companies was finalised after these firms revoked offers at more than one IIT. Some of them are data analytics and software-based firms. They, however, are allowed to place students through off-campus process.An IIT professor involved in the placement process said the names of the companies were cross-verified by placement coordinators at 15 IITs recently. “We looked at their past records too. Some of these companies had a history of revoking offers and six to seven IITs had already banned them from participation.Offers have been revoked by some companies where some alumni are working. There were also a few companies that reduced salary packages offered in the letter. The placement cells are trying to speak to higher authorities in these companies,” said the professor.Speaking about such cancellations, a computer science graduate from IIT-Bombay’s batch of 2025, said he was hired by a trading platform last December and his joining date was June 1, 2025. “My offer was revoked on May 29. The company made me an offer of nearly Rs 30 lakh and I was more than happy to join. They revoked my offer just two days before I was supposed to join, but fortunately, I got a better offer through an alumnus in some time. Though IIT-Bombay extended help, I did not need it at that time,” said the graduate. He said some of his friends’ offers were revoked too, but a few of them landed other offers. “By June and July it becomes difficult for the institutes too to help with placements as phase-II of the process concludes by the end of the academic year,” he said.The professor added that the IITs this year have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by the Centre under the Viksit Bharat programme. “The job market is slow, but we are trying to reach out to many more companies and encourage start-ups incubated on prominent campuses to reach the best targets,” he said, adding that so far the placement season looks good.","Firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year.

The bottom line

Global arms revenues surged to an all-time high of $679 billion in 2024, up 5.9% in real terms, according to the latest SIPRI Top 100 ranking. While Europe and the US drove most of the increase, Asia and Oceania stood out as the only region to post a decline—largely due to a dramatic drop in Chinese arms company revenues, the SIPRI report said.India, though still far from being a global arms giant, posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies. In sharp contrast, Chinese arms revenues fell 10%, a setback tied to a wave of high-profile corruption scandals and major contract delays that rattled Beijing's defense establishment.India’s three Top 100 firms-Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders-together pulled in $7.5 billion in arms revenue in 2024, up from $6.9 billion in 2023.BEL led the growth with a 24% revenue jump, hitting $2.47 billion. The boost came from domestic orders, particularly in radar systems and electronic warfare equipment, both prioritized in India’s military modernization drive.HAL, India’s top-ranked defense firm at rank 44 globally, earned $3.81 billion, a marginal 0.3% decrease from the previous year. The company faced delivery lags, but remained a cornerstone supplier to the Indian Air Force and Navy.Mazagon Dock, focused on naval shipbuilding, recorded $1.23 billion in arms revenue, with a 9.8% year-on-year increase, thanks to continued submarine and destroyer production.India is pressing ahead with its “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) campaign in defense production. While not grabbing global headlines, its incremental gains highlight an emerging industrial base that could challenge traditional suppliers over time.“The combined arms revenues of the three Indian companies in the Top 100 increased by 8.2 per cent to $7.5 billion on the back of domestic orders,” the SIPRI report said.The picture in China couldn’t be more different. For the first time in years, China’s eight arms producers in the SIPRI Top 100-previously hailed as key enablers of President Xi Jinping’s military modernization push-lost major ground.The steepest fall came from NORINCO, China’s primary land systems manufacturer, which saw its revenue plunge 31% due to corruption scandals and leadership upheaval.CASC, China’s aerospace and missile systems leader, dropped 16% following delays in military satellite programs and the removal of its president amid graft allegations.Even AVIC, the country’s biggest defense company, slipped 1.3%, hampered by delays in aircraft deliveries.“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or cancelled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, director of the SIPRI military expenditure and arms production programme.China’s top-down, state-controlled defense sector may be big-but its opacity leaves it vulnerable to internal shocks. Political purges tied to Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign disrupted procurement and leadership pipelines across several top defense firms.Only two of China’s eight arms producers recorded revenue growth-CSSC, the shipbuilding powerhouse, was one, rising 8.7%, aligned with China’s naval buildup in the South China Sea.India’s slow, state-driven growth might lack flash, but it also avoids the internal disarray seen in Beijing. Its procurement is transparent, aligned to strategic plans, and largely free of major political scandal.China, meanwhile, is still far ahead in sheer scale but vulnerable to top-level instability.While China dragged down the region’s total, other Asian powers picked up slack:South Korean arms producers rose 31% to $14.1 billion, driven by booming exports.Japan posted the largest jump in Asia: a 40% increase in arms revenues across five firms, reaching $13.3 billion, reflecting Tokyo’s shift toward proactive defense spending amid regional tensions.US firms remain the backbone of the global arms industry. The 39 American companies in the Top 100 generated $334 billion in arms revenues in 2024, a 3.8 per cent increase that leaves them with just under half of global Top 100 sales. Lockheed Martin alone booked $64.7 billion, while RTX, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics each sat comfortably above $30 billion.Yet the American giant is struggling to turn money into timely capability. Programmes such as the F-35 fighter, the Columbia-class nuclear submarine and the Sentinel ICBM are all running late and over budget. Lockheed’s F-35 deliveries in 2024 were delayed by an average of 238 days per aircraft, and the programme’s projected sustainment costs have ballooned towards $1.6 trillion over its life. Northrop’s Sentinel programme has breached US cost-growth thresholds by around 80 per cent versus its original estimate.SIPRI’s Xiao Liang warns that “The delays and rising costs will inevitably impact US military planning and military spending… This could have knock-on effects on the US government’s efforts to cut excessive military spending and improve budget efficiency.” In plain terms, even as the US spends more, it risks getting less capability per dollar.European producers surged by 13%, reaching $151 billion, as countries rearm in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.Russia’s corporate footprint in the SIPRI Top 100 remains surprisingly small—just two entities, Rostec and United Shipbuilding Corporation—but their combined arms revenues jumped 23 per cent in 2024 to an estimated $31.2 billion. Domestic demand linked to the Ukraine war more than offset shrinking exports. Russian plants have ramped up output of artillery shells, missiles and armoured vehicles; SIPRI cites reports of 1.3 million 152-mm shells produced in 2024, a more than fivefold increase over 2022.Where Russia is constrained, the Middle East is expanding. For the first time, nine companies from the region appear in the Top 100, with combined arms revenues of $31.0 billion, up 14 per cent where comparable data exist. Israeli firms alone generated $16.2 billion, a 16 per cent increase, fuelled both by the Gaza war and strong demand for uncrewed systems and missile defence worldwide.For India:Expect a continued push for domestic procurement and local manufacturing under the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP).India may look to expand exports, especially to Africa and Southeast Asia, but lacks the global competitiveness of Korean or Israeli systems.For China:Beijing still accounts for around 13 per cent of total Top 100 arms revenues, and its shipyards and missile producers have been central to the rapid expansion of the PLA Navy and rocket forces over the past decade.But the 2024 rankings hint at a temporary pause or re-ordering in its modernisation drive just as tensions over Taiwan and in the South China Sea remain high.Recovery will depend on restoring procurement integrity, managing talent loss, and containing political fallout.For Asia:The regional arms race is far from over.The pivot from importing to building continues—but success will depend on supply chain resilience, governance, and geopolitical alignment.India is climbing slowly, but surely-fueled by trust in institutions, steady demand, and political will.China, long considered an unstoppable defense juggernaut, now faces turbulence not from outside threats, but from within.In the evolving landscape of Asian defense, discipline may matter more than dominance. And for now, India is playing the long game.","India posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies.

Govt orders handset makers to preload its Sanchar Saathi app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-orders-handset-makers-to-preload-its-sanchar-saathi-app/articleshow/125704436.cms,"(Representative image)

Political Storm Over Sanchar Saathi As Opposition Calls It A Snooping Tool, Govt Defends Move

Govt: Sanchar Saathi must be visible, fully functional on devices

NEW DELHI: In a move that is causing some concern to the industry and privacy advocates, govt has asked smartphone makers to mandatorily pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on their devices. Govt says this is being done to strengthen cyber security on the devices and prevent tampering and spoofing of the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number.The order, originally issued on Nov 21, gives device makers - including Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and Chinese firms Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - 90 days to comply with the regulation or face penalties.Sanchar Saathi is pitched as a citizen-centric initiative of DoT that promises to ""empower mobile subscribers and strengthen their security"" while increasing awareness about govt initiatives.An order recently issued by govt to handset manufacturers states, ""Central govt hereby directs every manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets that are intended for use in India to... ensure that the Sanchar Saathi mobile application, as specified by DoT, is pre-installed on all mobile handsets manufactured or imported for use in India."" It also directs companies to ensure that the pre-installed app is ""readily visible and accessible to end users"" at the time of first use or device setup and that ""its functionalities are not disabled or restricted"".Nikhil Pahwa, founder of tech policy analysis company Medianama, said the order was ""bad news"" for mobile phone users and their privacy.

With former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia reported to be in a very critical condition, PM Narendra Modi expressed concerns about her failing health and offered all possible assistance to her. Modi’s gesture is significant as Zia has had a troubled past with India in contrast to her rival Sheikh Hasina’s warm and friendly ties with India. Zia’s party BNP accused the Indian govt of undermining democracy in Bangladesh by backing an “authoritarian” Hasina who was deposed last year and forced to flee to India.“Deeply concerned to learn about the health of Begum Khaleda Zia, who has contributed to Bangladesh’s public life for many years. Our sincere prayers and best wishes for her speedy recovery. India stands ready to extend all possible support, in whatever way we can,” said Modi in a post on X.Significantly, a team of Chinese doctors, apparently sent by Beijing, arrived in Dhaka on Monday to help in Zia’s treatment.This is not the first time Modi has reached out to Zia and her party. He had a meeting with her during his visit to Dhaka in 2015 that govt described as “full spectrum outreach” on Bangladesh.Modi’s message will also be seen as an acknowledgement of the new reality in Bangladesh - and re-evaluation of India’s position - which goes to polls early next year and the possible return to power of BNP, which is expected to gain majorly from Hasina’s ouster. According to a local survey last week, as reported by Prothom Alo, there’s a tight race currently between the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with the BNP holding a slight three-point lead. India has on several occasions said in the recent past it seeks fair and inclusive polls in Bangladesh.With his outreach, Modi is also doubling down on India’s position that it remains committed to the best interest of Bangladesh, including peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country and will continue to engage with all stakeholders. BNP too has said it wants “balanced and respectful” ties with India.",Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia reported to be in a very critical condition.

Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

Duo held similar breakfast meeting



NEW DELHI: Just as the Congress government in Karnataka crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, chief minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM D K Shivakumar are making a renewed show of unity amid an escalating leadership tussle.Siddaramaiah on Tuesday visited Shivakumar's residence for breakfast 2.0, a gesture seen as an attempt to ease tensions just days after the two senior Congress leaders held a similar meeting at the chief minister's home.The meeting came after the Congress high command nudged both leaders to sit together and present a united front ahead of the Belagavi legislature session beginning December 8. After the interaction, the leaders issued a statement reaffirming their ""commitment to good governance.""""Hosted the Hon'ble CM for breakfast at my residence today as we reaffirm our commitment to good governance and the continued development of our state under the Congress vision,"" Shivkumar posted on X.Shivakumar on Monday extended an invitation to the CM to join him for breakfast, and posted on X saying, ""Me and the CM continue to work together as a team. I have invited the Hon'ble CM for breakfast tomorrow to discuss and strengthen our collective efforts to deliver on our promises to Karnataka.""His comments came after Siddaramaiah told reporters ""that day (Saturday) he (Shivakumar) asked me to come to his house for breakfast on Tuesday. I have not received any call till now. If invited, I will go. He may call. I think he will invite me.""The outreach is part of efforts to break the leadership deadlock between the two.Just two days earlier on Saturday, Shivakumar had visited the CM's Cauvery residence for a similar breakfast meeting, which featured a traditional idli-vada-sambar spread.Following the breakfast, at a closely watched joint press briefing, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar dismissed reports of a rift as ""manufactured confusion"" and agreed to remain united until the high command takes up the issue.Siddaramaiah said the talks had gone well. ""Breakfast was very good. All three of us ( CM, deputy CM and advisor) enjoyed it. We want to put an end to the confusion. Our mission is very clear — local elections are very important, and for the 2028 elections we are ensuring that Congress comes back to power. There is no difference between me and DKS, not now, not before,"" he said.""The media has created this confusion. From tomorrow, let there be no confusion."" He reiterated that both leaders would abide by the direction of the Congress high command, saying, ""What the high command says, we will listen to and abide by,"" he added.Siddaramaiah further said that the Assembly session would be conducted smoothly and that the party would ""fight BJP and JD(S) together.""Shivakumar, echoed the same stating that, ""People have shown great trust and given a massive mandate to us. It is our duty to deliver to the people of Karnataka… Both of us have full trust in our leadership. One word from the high command, if they tell me to wait, I will wait. Both of us will follow whatever the high command says.""He added, ""Whatever the CM says, I agree with him. We will not allow outsiders to interfere.""Home minister G Parameshwara who is another name in fray for the CM post in the state acknowledged the stir, saying ""all we want is a peaceful settlement.""""It's a good thing that our leaders are getting together again for breakfast. All we want is a peaceful settlement of whatever has happened over the month or so. As suggested by the high command, they are meeting for the second time. All the issues are settled. It is just reciprocal, nothing else,"" he said.""Everything is going smoothly. Different people have different aspirations. I don't think it is wrong. Naturally, they express their aspirations when the time comes,"" he added.The show of unity comes amid intense speculation over a possible leadership change when the government completed half of its term.Rumours were fueled by talk of a 2023 ""power-sharing"" understanding under which Siddaramaiah would serve 2.5 years and Shivakumar would lead the remaining tenure, a deal neither leader has openly acknowledged, and which the party has never confirmed.While Siddaramaiah maintains he will complete the full five-year term, Shivakumar's camp has pushed for the alleged rotational formula. The high command is now working to keep both leaders aligned to avoid instability in the state.","Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift.Duo held similar breakfast meeting at the chief minister's home.

BSF warns of 120 terrorists on LoC launch pads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bsf-warns-of-120-terrorists-on-loc-launch-pads/articleshow/125702016.cms,"BSF IG Warns Of Looming Threat As 120 Terrorists Wait In PoK Despite Dip In Infiltration Attempts

SRINAGAR: Around “120 terrorists” positioned on 69 launch pads across the LoC are under close watch and the next phase of Operation Sindoor will be activated without hesitation if Pakistan attempts any “misadventure”, BSF Kashmir frontier IG Ashok Yadav said Monday.Yadav said during the border force’s annual briefing that Pakistan shifted several launch pads deeper inside its territory after Indian air and artillery strikes between May 7 and May 10, when Op Sindoor hit terrorist sites in retaliation for the Pahalgam massacre that killed 26 civilians on April 22.“We caused heavy damage during Op Sindoor. Some launch pads were moved from forward areas so they remain out of firing range of Indian Army and BSF,” Yadav said, adding that despite relocation, these sites remain under surveillance. “Whenever there is any misadventure from Pakistan, we are ready to give a befitting reply.”During the May offensive, Yadav said BSF units and Army formations executed “heavy and accurate” fire assaults on Pakistani posts and launch pads. “Our units, including artillery regiments, inflicted huge casualties on Pakistani troops, damaged forward posts and destroyed several terrorist pads along the LoC.”Asked why the 69 pads were not struck earlier, he said terrain and distance limited firing solutions.“We had them under radar. Location and depth from the LoC matter. From some points it is difficult to target all launch pads,” he said.Yadav reported a sharp drop in infiltration attempts. Four attempts were recorded this year in the Kashmir frontier — two before and two after Op Sindoor — involving 13 infiltrators. “Eight were eliminated by the Army, five retreated,” he said. While the broader infiltration pattern remains unchanged, he acknowledged emergence of new tracks. “We receive inputs on new routes and cover them with the Army,” he said.Inside Kashmir valley, BSF has 13 companies working with the Army and police. Yadav flagged “silent recruitment” of terrorists and said the force is focusing on institutions functioning as “radicalisation centres”. Alerts are passed to agencies responsible for the hinterland, he said, adding that “complete synergy” exists among security forces.Following the Pahalgam attack, specialised BSF teams were deployed in the Gulmarg bowl to reinforce tourist security. “Our teams are operating professionally and effectively,” Yadav said.Despite harsh terrain, snowbound stretches, threats of sneaky strikes by Pakistani Border Action Team (BAT), sniping, ceasefire violations and fidayeen strikes, BSF personnel continue LoC duties with “full zeal and devotion”, he said.","Around “120 terrorists’ positioned on 69 launch pads across the LoC are under close watch. “Whenever there is any misadventure from Pakistan, we are ready to give a befitting reply,” says BSF Kashmir frontier IG Ashok Yadav.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125702047,imgsize-1169991,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

SRINAGAR: CBI announced on Monday the arrest of a suspect wanted for 35 years for his alleged role in the 1989 abduction of former home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's daughter Dr Rubaiya Sayeed by the banned JKLF, whose jailed chief Yasin Malik is standing trial in the case.The central agency, which took over the case in 1990, identified the arrested man as ""absconder"" Shafat Ahmed Shangloo. He had a Rs 10 lakh bounty on his head.""Shangloo conspired with Yasin Malik and others in committing the crime. He will be produced in the TADA court, Jammu, at the stipulated time per law,"" CBI said.Rubaiya, who was 23 at the time, identified Yasin as one of her captors during a court hearing on July 15, 2022. Another witness backed her testimony in Feb 2023 when Yasin appeared at that hearing through video-conferencing from Tihar Jail, where he is serving a life sentence in a terror funding case.Rubaiya, the third of Mufti Sayeed's daughters and sister of PDP president and ex-J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti, was a medical intern when JKLF terrorists abducted her on Dec 8, 1989, from near her home in J&K's Nowgam. She was returning by bus from Lal Ded Memorial Hospital.The terrorists demanded the release of five of their jailed associates in return for Rubaiya's release. After six days of negotiations, Union govt freed the terrorists despite then J&K CM Farooq Abdullah being opposed to it. Rubaiya, who now lives in Tamil Nadu, was freed hours later.Mufti Sayeed, India's first Muslim home minister, was part the VP Singh-led Janata Dal govt.""Even if they had taken my daughter hostage, I would not have released a single terrorist,"" Farooq publicly said in 2015.On Sept 19 this year, Mehbooba wrote to home minister Amit Shah, urging him to view separatist Yasin's case through a humanitarian lens. She said his decision to ""renounce violence and embrace political engagement and non-violent dissent"" required courage that should not be overlooked.""I write to you not merely as a witness but as someone who has lived through the turbulent times of J&K, bearing its grief, enduring its silences, and holding on to its fragile hopes,"" Mehbooba wrote.Just over a week ago, a second ""key eyewitness"" identified Yasin in a Jammu court as the ""main shooter"" in the 1990 terrorist attack in which four unarmed IAF personnel waiting for a staff bus in Srinagar were killed and 22 others wounded.The unnamed witness's testimony came 22 months after a retired IAF colleague of the victims first identified the JKLF chief as the main armed assailant.","Shafat Ahmed Shangloo had a Rs 10 lakh bounty on his head.

When a finance executive at a British engineering firm, Arup, joined a routine Skype meeting in Jan 2024, familiar faces filled the screen. The company leaders he had interacted with countless times spoke with authority, blinked naturally, and smiled reassuringly. Except the people on screen were not real, and the AI-crafted doubles duped the firm, which worked on the Statue of Unity and India’s rail projects, of nearly $25 million. The deepfakes were so flawless that 15 transfers from the Hong Kong office went through before anyone realised the con.Months later, a deepfake surfaced closer to home. At the India office of a global chipmaker, a man used artificial intelligence (AI) to impersonate a real job candidate in an online interview. “He synced facial movements and tone quite well but we detected the use of deepfake tech, and he was out,” says Naveen Sharma, co-founder of Kroop AI, which built Vizmantiz, a detection tool for synthetic videos and audio.India’s deepfake saga began in 2020, when deepfake videos of politician Manoj Tiwari “speaking fluent Haryanvi” to appeal to voters went viral ahead of Delhi assembly polls. By mid-2023, the menace had turned personal: in Kerala, a 73-year-old man lost Rs 40,000 following a WhatsApp deepfake call seemingly from his friend, pleading for urgent help from Dubai.India recorded a staggering 280% year-on-year increase in deepfake incidents in Q1 2024, particularly in the leadup to national elections, reported Sumsub, a global identity verification provider. A McAfee survey in Nov 2024 found 75% of Indians had seen deepfake content in the past year, and 45%reported that they knew someone who had been duped by a deepfake fraud.“The term ‘deepfake’ covers both synthetic content created from scratch and manipulated content that alters existing videos,” said Sharma. “Both forms distort truth: one invents it, the other rewrites it.”Forensic experts are now learning to read what AI cannot hide. “Deepfake audio is often too clean, lacking normal background noise,” says Dr Surbhi Mathur, head of Centre of Excellence in Multimedia Forensics at National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU). “AI faces also lack natural light variations and photo response non-uniformity (PRNU) — the ‘fingerprint’ left by camera sensors. The facial micro-expressions often lacks natural blinking patterns, or the way someone moves their face or their hands near the face. ”Sandeep Shukla, director of International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, says, “There are tools that claim over 90% accuracy in deepfake detection. However, as these rely on neural network-based deep learning tech, there’s no guarantee that every form of media manipulation will be detected.” Police and judges must be trained in detection and its limits, he urges. “And, when guilt is proven, the punishment must be high enough to act as a deterrent. ”The surge in deepfake content is driven by mass appeal, says Mathur. “Scammers exploit trusted faces for massive financial gain.” Since 2023, the deepfakes analysis unit (DAU), established under the Misinformation Combat Alliance with support from the corporate affairs and IT ministries, has tracked hundreds of AI-created scams. Fabricated “endorsements” for investment schemes and gaming apps have used the faces of Ratan Tata, N R Narayana Murthy, Rahul Gandhi, Nirmala Sitharaman, Virat Kohli, and even doctors Naresh Trehan and Devi Shetty for bogus health cures. A viral Ratan Tata “investment video” was found to be 83.8% AI-generated. Tata later publicly debunked it on Instagram.In Nov 2023, a deepfake of actor Rashmika Mandanna was created by morphing influencer Zara Patel’s face. Experts warn that ‘DeepNude’ or AI-generated explicit content created without consent pose grave risks to women’s privacy.With no dedicated deepfake law, several Bollywood actors are taking legal recourse. Delhi HC has issued ‘John Doe’ orders that allow legal action against anonymous offenders. It introduced ‘dynamic+ injunctions’, which compel platforms to remove the original deepfake as well as proactively monitor and take down re-uploads.Sharma identified the “most dangerous” use of deepfakes in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector. He says that during online know your customer (KYC) processes,“I can clone a voice or face, and the system may verify that person as genuine”.To tackle this, the “first mandate” of the upcoming deepfake policy will require “BFSI to use deepfake detectors for KYC and document verification,” Sharma reveals. Amendments to the IT Rules, 2021, will enforce content labelling over 10% of the screen or audio, and faster takedowns — within 36 hours, or three hours during elections. “A person circulating or a platform hosting deepfake content, even unknowingly, will face legal action,” he says.However, experts say India must move faster. “Technology changes every 15-20 days and scammers evolve just as quickly,” warns Sharma.“We need laws, detection, and awareness that move at the same speed.”uses a public-private model for deepfake detection and digital forensicstackles image-based abuse, deepfake threatsallows anonymous reporting of deepfake, cyber abuse incidents to aid state police forcesfocuses on real-time deepfake detection for images, video, audiodevelops Explainable AI (Xai) for deepfakes, signature forgeryspecifically targets AI-generated voice impersonation to prevent fraud Images : AI‘Too clean’ audio lacking normal background noise is a red flagSounding scripted, robotic, lacking human cadence or characteristic pausesSudden changes in pitch, tone following awkward cut or pauseDistinct noise like human breathing, heard during pausesLip synchronisation errors or the mouth moving during audio pausesDeepfakes often miss the natural shadow effects and light variationsObjects near the face (e.g., microphone, hands) merging unnaturally into the chin or jawlineTeeth appearing blurred, inconsistent, or lacking definition, are common flawsUnique artefacts carried by the application that created the imageUses blood flow analysis to detect deepfakes by checking facial colouration caused by heartbeatsUsed to check if an audio is AI-generatedThe open platform detects synthetic contentProprietary software for voice and audio authenticity checkDetects AI images, especially from models like DALL·E 3","India recorded a staggering 280% year-on-year increase in deepfake incidents in Q1 2024, particularly in the leadup to national elections.

The 37-year-old will now move into the team’s support staff, taking on the role of “Power Coach” starting with the 2026 season.Russell shared the news on Instagram, thanking KKR fans and reflecting on a career filled with towering sixes, clutch finishes, and multiple MVP titles.India imported 5.4 million tonnes of Russian oil worth 2.1 billion euros between January and September 2025 using 30 tankers that allegedly sailed under false flags, a European think tank has reported.The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said these shipments made India the biggest destination for crude transported by Russia’s expanding “shadow fleet” that has emerged in response to Western energy sanctions imposed after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.","Pakistan rejects UN rights chief Volker Türk’s criticism of its 27th constitutional amendment.

Measures must be implemented round the year, says apex court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday bristled at attempts to pin the blame for Delhi-NCR air pollution on farm fires and asked the Union and NCR govts to detail measures taken on other pollution sources — vehicles, industries, construction, dust — and the tangible results achieved through implementation of such steps.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Aparajita Singh and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said stubble burning incidents contribute to pollution in Delhi-NCR for just 15 days in winter months, but there are other major causes of pollution which need to be addressed round the year.In defence of farmers, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “Let stubble burning not be made a political or ego issue. During Covid (lockdown), stubble burning was there. Yet, we could see stars in the night sky. You (govt) say measures have been taken. Still, we can’t see stars. What are the tangible results achieved through enforcement of graded action plan (Grap)? What actions have been taken against other sources of pollution?”What is being done about high-end gas guzzlers, the bench asked. “Strengthening quality public transport is key to reducing vehicular contribution towards air pollution. But that will take time and should be part of the long-term plan,” it said, adding that financial empowerment of people in India has led to a burgeoning number of cars in the capital city, which was not planned to accommodate so many people with individual vehicles.As Bhati informed the court that the number of incidents of stubble burning has gradually gone down in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, the bench asked if there has been corresponding improvement in air quality in Delhi-NCR. “Normatively, you might have banned construction activities but is there sincere implementation on the ground?”Bhati admitted that Grap restrictions have not been scrupulously enforced.The bench said that both short-term and long-term measures require intensive implementation round the year and promised that matters relating to air pollution would be heard by SC at least twice a month round the year.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar said all thermal power plants were required to implement sulphur dioxide emission control measures, primarily by installing the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system, by 2021.The deadline has been extended by the govt several times, and now the thermal power plants have been asked to implement the emission control measure by 2027-29, he said.When Bhati said that the govt has already filed both short-term and long-term plans to tackle the problem of air pollution, the bench asked why they are not been revisited if they have not been able to reduce pollution.On many occasions, the rural-urban bias of experts results in misdirection of efforts to curb pollution, it said, and suggested that experts aware of ground realities of India, not those who studied at Harvard or other foreign universities, prepare action plans.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Dec 10.","Supreme Court bristled at attempts to pin the blame for Delhi-NCR air pollution on farm fires.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday refused to extend time for the mandatory registration of all waqf properties on the UMEED portal and asked those who have not done so to approach the tribunal constituted under Waqf (Amendment) Act, which has the power to extend the period by six months.Running against time to comply with registration as the deadline is to expire on Dec 6, a batch of petitions were filed in the apex court, including by All India Muslim Personal Law Board, for extension of time on various grounds including because of technical glitches encountered in accessing the portal. But the Centre strongly opposed the plea saying the Act states the extension can be granted by the waqf tribunal and aggrieved persons should approach it.Appearing before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and M R Samshad said that so far, only around 1.6 lakh properties had been uploaded, and while the total number of such assets might be above 10 lakh, it would be difficult to upload details within the short span of time.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, however, said the court’s interference to extend the date would amount to amending the law itself which provided six months time.He also told SC the issue can be examined by the tribunal.Section 3B of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 says every waqf registered under this Act shall file the details of the waqf and the property dedicated to the waqf on the portal and database, within a period of six months from such commencement. It, however, provides that the tribunal may, on an application made to it by the mutawalli, extend such period of six months under this section for a further period not exceeding six months as it may consider appropriate, if he satisfies the tribunal that he had sufficient cause for not filing the details of the waqf on the portal within such period.Taking note that the issue could be examined by the tribunal, the bench refused to extend the time. SC said that facing technical problems in uploading details of the properties would be a valid ground to seek a further six months time from the tribunal. “Technical glitch is a very good reason to seek extension from tribunal,” the bench said.The court had in Sept declined to stay many of the provisions under challenge in a batch of petitions challenging the amendments, including the requirement for all waqfs to be registered under section 3B, considering such a registration requirement was there earlier as well.","Supreme Court on Monday refused to extend time for the mandatory registration of all waqf properties on the UMEED portal.

You can’t dictate timeline for govt call on

SIR debate

, Rijiju tells oppn

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties disrupted proceedings in Lok Sabha and walked out of Rajya Sabha on the first day of the winter session after govt refused to concede their demand to immediately allow a debate on the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls being conducted by Election Commission.They rejected the stand of parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju that the demand for debate over SIR was under consideration but govt could not be tied to a timeline.The forthcoming days are likely to see more disruptions as there is no indication that the govt might relent on its stand not to discuss the functioning of Election Commission, an independent body. The opposition is determined to force the issue and chose the path of confrontation despite misgivings among smaller INDIA bloc parties.There are signs suggesting that Trinamool is ploughing its own furrow in the matter (special intensive revision of electoral rolls being conducted by Election Commission) rather than following Congress. At a meeting of the grouping, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, is learnt to have repeated his “vote manipulation” charge — a clear sign that Congress would remain hewed to its stand opposing special intensive revision.There were repeated adjournments in the first half of the session as opposition shouted slogans disregarding Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s appeal not to do so. “You can raise slogans outside but not in the House,” he said. A bill introduced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to implement amendments to GST law in Manipur was passed in Lok Sabha amid the din.Sitharaman also introduced in Lok Sabha two new bills that seek to repurpose levies on ‘sin goods’ such as tobacco, pan masala and related products. However, with opposition persisting with its slogan shouting, the House had to be adjourned for the day in the second half.In Rajya Sabha, opposition MPs were on their feet to press their demand soon after the felicitation of chairman C P Radhakrishnan, who chaired the proceedings for the first time since his election as Vice President in Sept this year.TMC member Derek O’Brien said that parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju had promised them on Sunday to get back to them on their demand that SIR should be taken up under the broader agenda of “electoral reforms”. Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, and CPM’s John Brittas joined in the demand.They cited suicides by booth-level officers (BLOs) due to alleged workload, with Kharge calling for taking up the debate on SIR first as they have been demanding it since last session.Rijiju reiterated that their demand is under govt’s consideration and that he would get back as soon as possible. “Nobody is undermining the matter taken up by opposition. It is under consideration of govt. But you cannot impose conditions like taking up the discussion today. There are opposition parties other than a dozen (demanding debate on SIR), who represent different states and want discussion on other issues,” he said. Opposition MPs told Rijiju that he had promised on Sunday to convey to them govt’s decision by 9pm the same day. Rijiju, however, said opposition cannot dictate a timeline.“Timeline is not the problem. But there is a trust deficit,” retorted Derek. Opposition members then staged a walkout in protest, following which the Chair took up special mentions and Zero Hour.Opposition functionaries said that they will continue to stick to their demand for SIR discussion on Tuesday and will take stock of the situation on Wednesday amid slender hope in its ranks that govt could agree.INDIA bloc will protest against the SIR at the Parliament entrance on Tuesday morning, in what will be reminiscent of the Monsoon session that was washed out over protests against ‘vote chori’.Many eyebrows were raised when Trinamool did not join the meeting of INDIA bloc held at Congress’s initiative. Also, smaller parties from Kerala like CPI, CPM, RSP and IUML felt that complete washout of proceedings should be avoided as there were important issues to be highlighted.Congress president Kharge sympathised with them, but said the issue of SIR is important and govt should accept the demand for discussion even if it is under some other subject like “electoral reforms”.But, sources said, a difference of views was the reason why opposition has decided to take a fresh look at the issue after two days.",Opposition parties disrupted proceedings in Lok Sabha and walked out of Rajya Sabha on the first day of the winter session.

Political Storm Over Sanchar Saathi As Opposition Calls It A Snooping Tool, Govt Defends Move

In what raises privacy concerns and fears around state surveillance, govt has asked smartphone makers to mandatorily pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on their devices, ostensibly to strengthen cyber security on the devices and prevent tampering and spoofing of IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number.The order, originally issued on November 21, gives the device makers – ranging from Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and the Chinese lot of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo – 90 days to comply with the regulation or otherwise face penalties. The govt’s order is even valid for devices being imported to the country, or still in pre-sales transit.The direction -- that raised red flags within the industry as well as privacy advocates -- said, “Central govt hereby directs every manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets that are intended for use in India to… ensure that the Sanchar Saathi mobile application, as specified by Department of Telecom (DoT), is pre-installed on all mobile handsets manufactured or imported for use in India.”And to ensure that the exercise does not end up as mere eyewash, the order also asks the companies to ensure that the pre-installed Sanchar Saathi app is “readily visible and accessible to the end users” at the time of first use or device setup and that “its functionalities are not disabled or restricted”.The order said that a provision to follow the instructions should also be made for devices which are in transit for sales.“For all such devices that have already been manufactured and are in sales channels in India, the manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets shall make an endeavour to push the App through software updates.”Sanchar Saathi is pitched as a citizen-centric initiative of DoT that promises to “empower mobile subscribers, strengthen their security” while increasing awareness about govt initiatives.The direction has been given under the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024, and its further amendments. “Rule 5 of the Rules empowers the govt to establish digital or other mechanisms necessary to identify and report acts that may endanger telecom cyber security, and accordingly, the DoT has instituted the Sanchar Saathi App, that, inter-alia, enables stakeholders to report IMEI related suspicious misuse and also to verify authenticity of IMEIs used in mobile devices,” the order said.The order said that mobile handsets bearing duplicate or spoofed IMEI pose serious danger to telecom cyber security.Govt instructed the manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets to submit compliance reports to the DoT within 120 days from issue of the directions. “Failure to comply with these directions shall attract action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended), and other applicable laws.”","The order, originally issued on November 21, gives the device makers – ranging from Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and the Chinese lot of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo – 90 days to comply with the regulation.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court order for pan-India CBI probe into 'digital arrest' cases, while signifying the threat from digital scamsters, is important also because the opposition-governed states had withdrawn ""general consent"" to CBI to probe crimes in their territories.Keeping two other forms of cyber-crime - investment scams and part-time job scams - on the back burner, the bench said CBI shall investigate digital arrest scam cases, and the court will consider whether the other two forms of cyber-crime require court supervision/monitoring. Suspecting assistance to scamsters by banking system insiders, the bench said, ""CBI shall have a free hand to investigate bankers under Prevention of Corruption Act when they are suspected to be involved in the opening of 'mule accounts' where the fraudsters park their extorted monies. ""CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi said that given the magnitude of the crimes and the fact that many of them were being committed from 'scam hubs' located in foreign countries, ""we direct the CBI to coordinate with Interpol to lay their hands on the cyber-crime havens operating from abroad"".The bench also issued notice to RBI and asked it to explain to the court why artificial intelligence tools or machine-learning technologies should not be employed to identify mule accounts in banks and freeze the deposits suspected to be proceeds of crime.The court also directed the IT intermediaries to preserve data relating to phones and equipment used by fraudsters, provide it to CBI and render full assistance to the central agency as and when sought in a particular case or in general.The bench further said that there is widespread breach of norms in issuance of SIM cards. ""Facts brought on record so far reveal an alarming negligent and irresponsible approach of telecom service providers while issuing multiple SIM cards in one name. We direct the DoT to submit a proposal for the consideration of SC, which may eventually be required to be implemented to prevent misuse of SIM cards,"" it said.SC directed all states and UTs to ensure establishment of regional/state Cyber-Crime Coordination Centres and operationalise them for better coordination with Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) of MHA so that effective steps could be taken against cyber-crimes, especially digital arrest scam cases.It asked MHA, ministry of finance, DoT, MeitY to submit a detailed plan of action for coordinated steps against digital arrest scam cases.The court adjourned hearing on the case by two weeks to enable CBI to choose experienced hands from state police forces as well as experts in information technology who can assist it in investigating digital arrest cases across India.","Supreme Court order for pan-India CBI probe into 'digital arrest' cases.

PM Modi’s ‘Drama Nahi, Delivery’ Message Sets Fiery Tone As Winter Session Begins Amid Tensions

NEW DELHI: New complex housing the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) will be called ‘Seva Teerth’, officials said on Tuesday.Earlier known as the ‘Executive Enclave’, the complex is now in its final stages of completion, marking a significant step in the Central Vista redevelopment.Officials described Seva Teerth as a workplace designed to reflect the spirit of service, a space “where national priorities take shape”. They said India’s public institutions were undergoing a “quiet but profound shift”, with governance moving from “satta (power) to seva (service)” and from authority to responsibility.“The change was not just administrative, but cultural and moral,” they added, as quoted by PTI.The enclave will house the PMO along with the offices of the Cabinet Secretariat, the National Security Council Secretariat and India House, which will serve as a venue for high-level talks with visiting dignitaries.As part of this broader shift in governance philosophy, Raj Bhawans—the official residences of state governors—are being renamed ‘Lok Bhawans’.The Central Secretariat, too, is now known as Kartavya Bhavan.Officials said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , spaces of governance have been reshaped to reflect ‘kartavya’ (duty) and transparency. “Every name, every building and every symbol now points to a simple idea. Government exists to serve,” they said.Several landmarks have already been renamed in recent years. Rajpath became Kartavya Path, while the prime minister’s official residence was renamed Lok Kalyan Marg in 2016, a name intended to convey welfare rather than exclusivity.“These changes mark a deeper ideological transition. Indian democracy is choosing responsibility over power and service over status,” officials said. “A shift in names is also a shift in mindset. Today, they speak the language of seva, kartavya and citizen-first governance,” they added.","New complex housing the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) will be called ‘Seva Teerth’, officials said on Tuesday.

DGCA Plans New Rules For Power Banks On Flights After Fire Scare On IndiGo Plane

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has grounded an Air India aircraft and launched a detailed investigation after the airline reported that the aircraft had operated eight revenue sectors on an expired Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC).According to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, quoted in the press note shared by ANI, ""Air India informed the regulator on 26 November 2025 that one of its aircraft had been inadvertently deployed for commercial flights despite the ARC having lapsed. The ARC is a mandatory annual certification that validates an aircraft’s continued compliance with airworthiness standards and its main Certificate of Airworthiness. ""In the press note, the ministry explained that the lapse occurred in the context of the ongoing merger of Vistara into Air India. As part of the transition, all 70 Vistara aircraft required renewed ARCs in 2024, with the DGCA assuming responsibility for issuing the certificates post-merger. While 69 aircraft received renewed ARCs after satisfactory checks, the 70th aircraft was grounded for an engine change after the operator filed its renewal application.During this period, its ARC expired, but the aircraft was subsequently released for service.Once the lapse was detected, the DGCA instructed Air India to immediately ground the aircraft and began an inquiry into how it was allowed to operate without a valid ARC. The certification process for the aircraft is now under way.The ministry said the personnel involved have been de-rostered with immediate effect pending the outcome of the probe.

On a crisp winter morning, when the sun struggles to cut through a grey, smoky haze, many of us glance at the air-quality index like a daily horoscope, the number that decides whether we mask up, skip a walk, or brace for another day of breathing toxic air. But what do those figures actually mean for our lungs? Why does 200 feel unbearable while 500 feels apocalyptic? And as smoke from stubble burning mixes with vehicular and industrial pollution , what is all that particulate matter really doing inside the body?Here is a look at the mechanics of the AQI, and what a pulmonologist wants you to know before the next toxic plume rolls in.For years, India’s air-quality data was buried in technical charts and numbers, leaving most people unsure of what the readings meant for the air they breathed. Without a clear, accessible system, public engagement with pollution remained limited.To change this, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) set out to create a national Air Quality Index (AQI) that could translate complicated measurements into simple, accessible categories. An expert group, bringing together doctors, air-quality scientists, academics, NGOs, state pollution boards, and technical inputs from IIT Kanpur, developed what eventually became India’s AQI.A draft was released in October 2014 for public and institutional feedback, and after detailed review, the national framework was finalised.The AQI is designed to tell people, at a glance, not just how polluted the air is, but what that level of pollution could mean for their health. It classifies air quality into six categories:. The index accounts for eight major pollutants with 24-hour standards and calculates individual sub-indices for each as long as there is data for at least three pollutants, one of them necessarily PM2.5 or PM10, an AQI can be computed. The highest (or “worst”) sub-index becomes the overall AQI number for that location.The AQI measures key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Among them, PM2.5 is considered the most harmful because its tiny particles can travel deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, leading to serious health risks. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advises keeping PM2.5 levels below 5 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) annually, and under 15 µg/m³ for 24 hours.The US AQI, like India’s, runs on a 0–500 scale, but with one key difference. Its highest category, “hazardous,” begins at 301 with no upper cap, so readings can go well beyond 500. The two countries also use different formulas to calculate their scores, which means the same pollution data can produce different AQI values. In short, the Indian and US scales don’t line up exactly and can’t be directly compared.Every winter, vast stretches of northern India, from Punjab and Haryana to neighbouring states, witness the burning of leftover crop stubble as farmers clear their fields for the next sowing season. This practice, known as crop residue burning (CRB), remains a persistent environmental challenge in India and many agricultural regions around the world.CRB is a major driver of fine particulate pollution, especially PM2.5, that engulfs Delhi and the wider NCR region each winter. These microscopic particles pose a heightened health threat, not only to residents but also to farmers living in and around the burn sites. Because PM2.5 particles are small enough to penetrate deep into the respiratory system, they can lodge along the delicate lining of the alveoli in the lungs.A growing body of scientific evidence links PM2.5 exposure to significant health risks. Short-term exposure can impair lung function and worsen conditions like asthma and heart disease. Over the long term, the dangers intensify; prolonged inhalation has been associated with chronic bronchitis, reduced lung capacity, and increased mortality linked to lung cancer and cardiovascular illnesses.Delhi has once again topped the charts as India’s most polluted city, according to a decade-long AQI assessment by Climate Trends covering 2015 to November 2025. The analysis shows that no major Indian city has reached safe air-quality levels at any point in the past ten years, underscoring the severity of the national pollution crisis.Delhi remains the worst-hit, followed by Noida, which recorded an alarming AQI of 515. Other heavily polluted regions include Cooch Behar (362), Kishanganj (351), and Kultali (332), reflecting how toxic air has spread far beyond the metros and deep into smaller districts. The data points to a nationwide public-health emergency, with the capital continuing to sit at the centre of India’s pollution burden.Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care and pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital in Gurugram, says the body reacts almost immediately when pollution levels rise. Fine particles irritate and inflame the airways, leading to coughing, excess mucus, and reduced lung function, while the heart and blood vessels come under added strain due to oxidative stress, constricted vessels, and a heightened tendency for clotting.""The cardiovascular system also responds to pollution by inducing oxidative stress, blood vessel constriction, and an increased tendency toward blood clotting.""At an AQI of around 200, the body experiences noticeable but manageable stress; symptoms like throat irritation, headaches, and breathlessness are common, especially for vulnerable groups. But when levels reach 500, the exposure becomes overwhelming. Inflammation intensifies, asthma can worsen quickly, blood pressure may rise, and even healthy people may struggle with oxygen exchange. Sustained exposure at this severity can lead to acute respiratory or cardiac complications, Dr Grover adds.Surface pollution from stubble burning and urban sources exposes people to PM2.5, PM10 and carbon monoxide, the dominant winter pollutants. The tiniest of these, PM2.5, can slip past the body’s natural defences, lodge deep in the lungs, and even enter the bloodstream. Carrying toxic metals and reactive chemicals, these particles spark chronic inflammation and gradual tissue damage. Over time, doctors see faster loss of lung function, recurring bronchitis, worsening asthma, and higher risks of heart and vascular disease.""Long-term exposure also increases risks of lung cancer, preterm birth, and impaired cognitive development in children. The cumulative effect of this pollution is almost akin to the long-term effects of smoking in some highly polluted regions,"" Dr Grover said.Children, pregnant women, and older adults face greater risks as AQI levels climb because their bodies are more vulnerable to pollution-induced stress. Children breathe faster and have developing lungs, making AQI levels above 150 likely to trigger coughing, wheezing, and fatigue.Pregnant women, who already have reduced oxygen reserves, may experience breathlessness when pollution rises above 200, and prolonged exposure has been linked to complications such as ""low birth weight and preterm labour."" Older adults, especially those with heart or lung conditions, can develop chest tightness, irregular heartbeat, or worsening COPD even at AQI 150–200, said Dr Grover.On the other hand, for people with asthma or chronic bronchitis, polluted air intensifies existing inflammation.Irritants like PM2.5 and ozone narrow the airways, increase mucus, and heighten sensitivity to triggers, leading to more frequent wheezing, coughing, breathlessness, and greater reliance on rescue inhalers. High pollution days also increase the risk of asthma attacks, respiratory infections, and a faster decline in lung function.""Patients should follow their treatment plans closely, avoid outdoor activity at times of peak pollution, and use preventive medication as recommended by their clinician,"" Dr Grover said.On days when air quality plunges into the “very poor” or “severe” range, the most important strategy is reducing total exposure, said Dr Grover.Indoors, keeping windows shut, avoiding smoke or incense, and using a certified HEPA purifier can significantly lower pollutant levels. Outside, it's best to limit activity, especially exercise, which draws particles deeper into the lungs. Only well-fitted N95 or FFP2 masks offer real protection; cloth and surgical masks do little to block PM2.5.Supporting measures like staying hydrated, using nasal saline rinses, and closely monitoring symptoms help reduce irritation. People with chronic lung or heart conditions should keep medications handy and follow their action plans carefully. Avoiding peak pollution hours, typically early mornings and evenings, remains one of the simplest ways to cut exposure.As winter smog thickens and AQI levels swing from unhealthy to severe, the message from experts is clear: pollution is not just an environmental issue but a direct, measurable threat to health.From choosing the right mask to avoiding peak smog hours and protecting vulnerable groups, even small, consistent steps can significantly cut exposure. And while individual action offers only partial defence, experts say awareness is the first line of protection until long-term, systemic solutions begin to clear the air for good.","The AQI measures key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Its highest category, “hazardous,” begins at 301 with no upper cap, so readings can go well beyond 500. The AQI is designed to tell people, at a glance, not just how polluted the air is, but what that level of pollution could mean.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125715932,imgsize-1223356,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-generated-image.jpg"

Why Did Pakistan Navy Stay Out During Operation Sindoor: Indian Navy Chief Reveals Stunning Details

NEW DELHI: Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi on Tuesday said that India’s third indigenously built nuclear-powered submarine will be commissioned soon. Speaking ahead of Navy Day, he also explained how the Navy’s strong action during counterterror Operation Sindoor forced Pakistan’s naval forces to stay close to their coastline.Admiral Tripathi said, ""The aggressive posturing and immediate action during Operation Sindoor… forced Pakistan Navy to remain close to their ports or near the Makran coast."" He added that the operation is still ongoing.He also described how busy the Navy has been over the past year, completing 11,000 ship days and 50,000 flying hours since the last Navy Day. One Indian ship has been continuously deployed in the Gulf of Aden since 2008 for anti-piracy duties, and 138 ships have taken part so far, escorting more than 3,700 merchant vessels from different countries.Admiral Tripathi said the Navy has received international recognition, noting that one naval ship was praised by the International Maritime Organisation for rescuing nine crew members from an Omani vessel last year. He added, ""I also got a thank-you letter from the chief of the Oman Navy.""Vice Admiral K Swaminathan, head of the Western Naval Command, also highlighted the impact of Operation Sindoor, launched after the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.The operation destroyed nine major terror hubs in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and damaged key airbases.He said Operation Sindoor saw an unprecedented mobilisation of more than 30 ships and submarines in a short period. ""Our frontline ships were poised for combat off the Makran coast, under the umbrella of Vikrant Carrier Battle Group,"" he said.Swaminathan added that the Navy’s strong posture played a major role in Pakistan seeking a ceasefire, saying, ""The threat of offensive action by the Indian Navy could be considered one of the important factors in Pakistan requesting for a ceasefire.""",Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said India's third indigenously built nuclear-powered submarine will be commissioned soon.

Amit Shah Blames Infiltration For Muslim Population Growth, Backs CAA As Moral Responsibility

The Supreme Court on Tuesday took a sharp stance while hearing a habeas corpus plea alleging the custodial disappearance of Rohingya individuals and seeking that any deportation follow due process, asking whether “intruders” should be given a “red carpet welcome,” as reported by LiveLaw. Chief Justice of India Surya Kant, sitting with Justice Joymalya Bagchi, questioned the basis of the plea, asking, ""Where is the order of the Government of India declaring them (Rohingyas) as refugees? Refugee is a well defined legal term… If there is no legal status of a refugee, and somebody is an intruder, and he enters illegally, do we have an obligation to keep that fellow here?""The petitioner’s counsel clarified that no refugee status was being sought -- only that deportation must follow law.LiveLaw quoted the bench saying: ""If they don't have legal status to stay in India… If an intruder comes, do we give them a red carpet welcome saying we would like to give you all facilities? What is the problem in sending them back?""CJI Kant further remarked on illegal entry, saying: ""First you enter, you cross the border illegally… Then you say, now that I have entered, your laws must apply to me… Do we want to stretch the law like this?""","The Supreme Court on Tuesday took a sharp stance while hearing a habeas corpus plea alleging the custodial disappearance of Rohingya individuals.
