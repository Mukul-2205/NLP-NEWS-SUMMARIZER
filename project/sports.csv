ILT20 CEO David White EXCLUSIVE: On Season 4, growth, challenges and IPL link

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s domestic season slipped further on Tuesday as the team lost to Tripura for the first time ever in domestic cricket, suffering a 12-run defeat in the Elite Group D match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Ahmedabad. The setback added to a growing list of results under scrutiny, coming soon after Delhi were beaten by Jammu and Kashmir in the Ranji Trophy Indrajit Debnath held his nerve and defended 20 runs off the last over as Tripura defeated a team filled with IPL players by 12 runs.DDCA officials are expected to face questions about team selection and the choice of support staff, including the appointment of Sarandeep Singh. Delhi now need an unlikely sequence of results to qualify for the Ranji Trophy knock-outs, even if they win their remaining two matches.In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Delhi have lost two of their four games, putting them under pressure. Chasing 158, their batting unit struggled on a slow surface and finished at 145 for 8. Mani Shankar Murasingh’s seam bowling and Viki Saha’s off-spin kept Delhi from building any momentum.Murasingh, who has played domestic cricket for around a decade, dismissed Punjab Kings and India A batter Priyansh Arya early in the innings.Before that, he had scored 25 not out off 18 balls, hitting a six and a four in the final over bowled by Ayush Badoni. He later returned figures of 2 for 19 from four overs, including 14 dot balls.Murasingh, referred to by teammates as the ""Ben Stokes of Tripura,"" used slow off-cutters and pace-off variations effectively on a tacky pitch. His bowling troubled Delhi captain Nitish Rana , who scored 45 off 40 balls, along with Ayush Badoni (14 off 13) and Priyansh Arya (8 off 10).Viki Saha dismissed Rana by shortening the length, drawing him out of the crease. The ball turned enough for wicketkeeper Sentu Sarkar to complete the stumping.",Delhi lose to Tripura for the first time ever in domestic cricket.

Poll What are your thoughts on the significance of Sindarov's victory at the FIDE World Cup? It inspires young players globally It's just another tournament win It highlights Uzbekistan's chess potential

ALSO READ:

NEW DELHI: It motivates. Watching others climb the podium, lift titles, and make their nations proud — it motivates the next in line.Just last week, Uzbekistan's Javokhir Sindarov rewrote a piece of chess history in Goa, winning the FIDE World Cup and becoming the youngest-ever champion at just 19. His win in the World Cup has also secured him a place in the 2026 Candidates Tournament, with a victory there potentially setting up a blockbuster World Championship showdown against India’s Gukesh Dommaraju.Keeping tabs on Sindarov’s title charge from her couch was Kazakhstan’s Grandmaster (GM) Bibisara Assaubayeva, a two-time World Blitz Champion and the youngest ever to do so.""I followed the tournament from the beginning, and my closest friend won the World Cup. So I'm so happy and very proud of him,"" Bibisara told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interaction.“Yes, we talked after the game. He (Sindarov) wrote to me that he won, but I already knew, and I was super happy because I followed the games live... It’s the first big step for Uzbek chess in the main tournaments because before this, they had only won team events.I’m so happy that two Uzbek guys reached the quarterfinals, and one of them just won the tournament.""Bibisara started learning chess at a young age of four from her grandfather, but the real grind began after she became an International Master (IM) in 2020. The pursuit of her GM title stretched longer than she expected, finally ending this year at the Sharjah Masters.""I got my first GM norm when I was 17, I think. Then I earned my second GM norm when I was 19. After that, I played a lot of tournaments where my rating was close to 2500. I had many events where, in the last round, I needed a win or even a draw for my final GM norm, and many times I lost those games. It was really heartbreaking,"" she sighed.Opening up about her final push at Sharjah, she recalled, “I wanted to become a grandmaster earlier, but I’m happy that I finally achieved it this year.""In the last round, I again needed just a draw to claim my final norm. I played against my compatriot from Kazakhstan, Rinat Jumabayev. He’s a grandmaster and the number one player in our country. We played for maybe four hours or more; we were one of the last games to finish in the hall. At some point, I had a worse position, but I managed to hold the draw. And I was super happy that I finally didn’t miss my chance.”With the GM title finally under her belt, the 21-year-old now wants to emulate Sindarov and secure a place in the Women’s Candidates next year.""I won my first world championship (in blitz) at 17 and the second one at 18. I grabbed second place in the rapid section, but now, I prefer to focus on classical chess because I want to first qualify for the Candidates tournament,"" she added.Still, she hasn’t turned her back on the faster formats. Bibisara has confirmed her participation in the upcoming World Women's Rapid and Blitz Championships in Doha.Already a two-time World Blitz Champion, she is more interested in clinching the World Rapid Championship title this year. However, ask her for advice on the faster formats of chess, and she laughs it off: ""Just play fast. I think it's the best advice.""Before heading to Doha, she will compete in the third season of the Global Chess League (GCL), representing the American Gambits. In January 2026, she will move to Tata Steel Chess India in Kolkata, followed by the prestigious Tata Steel Masters in Wijk aan Zee.But amid the busy calendar, her eyes are set firm: “My main goal is to qualify for the Candidates, because there is one last spot from the FIDE Circuit (FIDE Women’s Events 2024-25 series) and I’m the leader now. So I hope I will qualify. That’s my main goal.”",Kazakhstan's Bibisara Assaubayeva is a two-time World Blitz Champion and the youngest ever to do so. She followed Uzbekistan's Javokhir Sindarov's FIDE World Cup win from her couch.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi kept his strong run in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) on Tuesday with another significant performance for Bihar. The 14-year-old scored an unbeaten 108 off 61 balls against Maharashtra in an Elite Group B match played at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. His innings included seven fours and seven sixes, and he played through the 20 overs to take Bihar to 176 for 3.By reaching three figures, Suryavanshi became the youngest player in the history of the tournament to hit a hundred. He achieved the record at 14 years and 250 days of age. The hundred also continued his productive year in T20 cricket. Suryavanshi now has three T20 hundreds in 2025, which puts him joint-first among Indian players this year along with Abhishek Sharma. Ayush Mhatre and Ishan Kishan have two hundreds each.Suryavanshi has scored three hundreds in only 16 T20 innings. This puts him third on the list for the fewest innings taken to reach three hundreds in the format. The top two places are held jointly by Ian Harvey of Australia and Darius Visser of Samoa, who both reached three T20 hundreds in 11 innings.Meanwhile, Bihar’s total did not prove enough in the SMAT match. Maharashtra captain Prithvi Shaw led the chase with a 30-ball 66 at the top of the order. Shaw is aiming to draw the attention of IPL teams after going unsold in the IPL 2025 auction, and his quick start gave Maharashtra early control.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

India may have drawn first blood in the Ranchi ODI against South Africa, but head coach Gautam Gambhir continues to remain under a cloud of criticism following the recent Test series debacle. India were blanked 2-0 by the Proteas, adding to an already tense atmosphere around Gambhir’s leadership. Since taking charge, he has overseen two home Test series defeats, first against New Zealand and now against South Africa, prompting fans to vent their frustration at the former opener.The anger reached a flashpoint after the crushing 408-run defeat in Guwahati, where sections of the crowd began chanting ‘Gambhir Aye Haye’. The situation escalated so rapidly that batting coach Sitanshu Kotak and fast bowler Mohammed Siraj had to step in to pacify the spectators. Adding fuel to the fire, fans continue to debate Gambhir’s equations with Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , and many have even begun speculating about the ODI futures of both senior players.Amid this growing unrest, former India fast bowler Zaheer Khan , who shared the 2011 World Cup dressing room with Gambhir, urged the coach to toughen up and face the criticism calmly.“Emotions run high. When you’ve been winning consistently, expectations rise. Accountability will always follow,” Zaheer told Cricbuzz. He added that the role naturally invites scrutiny and that Gambhir must learn to remain balanced and handle public backlash with resilience.“You’ve got to be thick-skinned to deal with these kinds of criticism. It comes with the passion and expectations surrounding the team,” he said.India’s recent form under Gambhir has not helped his cause. The team lost an ODI series to Sri Lanka last year, followed by a surprise whitewash in New Zealand. Overall, India have lost five of their last seven Tests with Gambhir at the helm.Zaheer further stressed that Gambhir must be more open about his vision, saying that supporters appreciate honesty and clarity regarding selection choices and long-term plans.Gambhir has been criticised for fielding too many all-rounders in the Test XI at the cost of specialists. He also drew sharp reactions for preparing a rank turner in Kolkata against South Africa, despite India previously suffering a 0-3 defeat on similar surfaces in New Zealand.Zaheer suggested that communication is key. “Disappointment comes because everyone knows the team can perform better. It’s a phase, and emotions naturally rise. That’s why the team management needs to engage with fans openly. They understand more than people think,” he said.He concluded by saying that as long as the team sticks to a process aimed at sustainable success, transparency will help ease frustration among supporters. “If the team is clearer and more vocal about its thought process, the fans will understand where they’re coming from. It’s important not to get carried away,” Zaheer added.",Gautam Gambhir has been criticised for fielding too many all-rounders in the Test XI at the cost of specialists.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

Poll Who do you think is primarily responsible for India's decline in Test cricket? Players Team Management Both equally External Factors

NEW DELHi: Former head coach Ravi Shastri has delivered one of his most pointed critiques yet of India's dramatic fall in Test cricket, declaring that both players and the team management must take responsibility for the decline. The former India head coach, who oversaw the team's successful run alongside Virat Kohli, said he is deeply hurt by the sight of a side that once dominated home and away now suffering whitewashes against New Zealand and South Africa at home.Shastri, speaking to Prabhat Khabar in a podcast teaser, was visibly frustrated while recalling India's collapse in the Guwahati Test. “You tell me. What happened in Guwahati – from 100/1, you skip to 130/7? This team is not that bad either. They have this much talent at least. The players should take some responsibility too. You have played spin since you started playing cricket,” he said.Asked whether he was defending new head coach Gautam Gambhir , Shastri was blunt. “I'm not protecting [him]. One hundred per cent he is responsible too. When am I saying anything otherwise?” he said.Then came his most striking comment. “Agar yeh mere saath hota, main pehla responsibility leta (Had this happened with me, I would have been the first one to take responsibility). But then, I wouldn't have spared the players either in the team meeting.”The frustration stems from high standards Shastri's own tenure had set. Between 2017 and 2021, India became the world's best travelling Test side, winning two historic series in Australia, staying No. 1 for 42 months and losing only two matches at home under Kohli.While Rahul Dravid revived the team after a slow start, leading India to home series wins and a second WTC final, that trajectory has stalled under Gambhir. India have managed just two Test series victories in 14 months — against Bangladesh and West Indies — while suffering heavy defeats in Australia and a draw in England.",Ravi Shastri says both players and team management must take responsibility for India's dramatic fall in Test cricket.

I’m really excited to play more ODIs as well. When Rohit bhai and Virat bhai are in the same team, the confidence level is completely different. They have so much experience and knowledge, and I try to take as much advice from them as possible to get better.I speak to Virat bhai a lot, especially about fitness and running between the wickets. His intensity is incredible. I love running too, and I feel I’m pretty quick, so I really enjoy that part of the game. If we play together, running between the wickets with him is something I look forward to.”Varma also highlighted Gambhir’s role in helping him stay grounded and competitive.“Gautam sir always gives me confidence. He tells me that if you have the skill, you can play all formats and do well in all formats. He puts me under pressure in practice sessions so I can learn how to handle pressure in matches. He keeps challenging me because he believes I have the capability. That backing means a lot to me.”Looking ahead to the second ODI in Raipur on Wednesday, Varma remains determined to make the most of future chances.“Whatever opportunities I get against South Africa, I want to finish those matches. I want to prove myself in ODIs and Tests too. I’m challenging myself to perform in the longer formats and grow as an individual player.”","India edged past South Africa by 17 runs in a tightly contested first ODI at the JSCA International Stadium Complex, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

Why Indian cricket needs Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli... more than ever

India all-rounder Hardik Pandya marked his return to competitive cricket with a brilliant unbeaten half-century, guiding Baroda to a thrilling seven-wicket win over Punjab in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Hyderabad on Tuesday.Playing his first match since the Asia Cup in September, Pandya looked in full command as he powered Baroda to a massive chase of 223, the third-highest successful run chase in the tournament’s history. Walking in under pressure, the 32-year-old produced a dynamic knock of 77 not out from 42 deliveries, striking seven fours and four sixes. He finished the match in style, smashing three sixes in a row to seal victory with five balls remaining.Pandya also rolled his arm over earlier in the game, picking up a wicket though his four-over spell proved expensive.The match saw a brief, unexpected interruption when a fan sprinted onto the field to meet Pandya during Baroda’s bowling innings. The intruder managed to get close enough to take a selfie with the star all-rounder before security intervened. Pandya was seen signalling the officials not to act harshly towards the fan, a gesture that quickly went viral on social media.Earlier, Punjab posted a strong total of 222 for 8, with Anmolpreet Singh blasting 69 off 32 and Abhishek Sharma smashing a rapid 50 from just 19 balls. However, Baroda’s chase was paced perfectly, with Pandya’s explosive finish sealing a memorable win in 19.1 overs.The outing marks an encouraging return for Pandya after his injury setback, which had ruled him out of the Australia tour and the Asia Cup final against Pakistan.","Hardik Pandya scores 77 not out in Baroda's seven-wicket win over Punjab.

ILT20: Six teams, new captains, old excitement

Poll What do you think is the main reason for Salman not receiving a No-Objection Certificate? Performance issues Lack of interest from franchises Disciplinary reasons

Pakistan's T20 captain Salman Ali Agha has emerged as the lone contracted player not given clearance to participate in overseas franchise leagues during the crucial December–January window — raising questions about both his form and his future in Pakistan's shortest-format plans.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has approved No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) for 12 national players to feature in global leagues ahead of the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka next year. But Salman, who has led Pakistan's T20 side since December 2024, stands out as the only centrally contracted player not playing in any league this winter.As per a PTI report, PCB sources say Salman's exclusion is not a disciplinary call — rather a reflection of the market. Unlike Pakistan's top white-ball names, he has not attracted meaningful interest from franchise teams, with coaches and analysts questioning his impact value and role clarity in T20 cricket.With no team seeking his services, the PCB did not process any NOC for Salman. His absence from leagues is further amplified by the fact that almost all of Pakistan's frontline stars are set for game time worldwide.This season, Pakistani players will feature in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), ILT20 in the UAE, and the Big Bash League (BBL).The BBL will host Pakistan's biggest names, including Babar Azam , Shaheen Shah Afridi, Mohammad Rizwan, Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf. The BPL has signed 11 Pakistan players, while Fakhar Zaman, Naseem Shah and Usman Tariq are confirmed for the ILT20.However, most of these stars will likely cut short their stints as PCB is finalising a three-match T20 series in Sri Lanka, followed by another against Australia at home starting January 30.

WPL Auction: Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal on women's cricket after India's World Cup win

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals head coach Hemang Badani has opened up on the franchise’s bold decision to release Faf du Plessis, calling it one of the toughest calls ahead of the IPL mini-auction in Abu Dhabi. Du Plessis, who announced his retirement from the league on Monday, enjoyed a celebrated IPL career with Chennai Super Kings, Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Rising Pune Supergiant before joining DC last season.“It’s never easy to release a player of Faf du Plessis’ caliber. Letting him go was a really tough decision because he has been a stellar performer in the IPL for many years,” Badani said during the TATA IPL Retention show on Jiostar.Badani revealed that DC’s shift toward a younger, more explosive batting profile played a decisive role. “We felt it was time to move towards a younger option, someone who could bring a more aggressive style that fits the brand of cricket we want to play.”He also explained the reasoning behind cutting ties with Jake Fraser-McGurk, one of last season’s brightest young performers. “We backed him based on how he played last year, but at nine crore, we didn’t feel we got enough value from that investment.So, we felt it was best to let him go as well,” Badani said, adding that DC are “quite pleased” with their current squad.Former India captain Anil Kumble, meanwhile, believes Delhi must urgently finalise their top-order combination. “They absolutely need to lock in their opening combination,” Kumble said. “Nitish Rana, KL Rahul, Karun Nair and Abhishek Porel give them strong Indian options, but consistency is key.”Kumble also pointed to Sunrisers Hyderabad as a team needing significant middle-order and bowling reinforcements, suggesting David Miller as a potential fit alongside Heinrich Klaasen.The IPL auction will take place on December 16 in Abu Dhabi.",Faf du Plessis announced his retirement from the IPL on Monday.

TimesofIndia.com in Dubai:

Excerpts from the interview...

You have been part of so many franchises and have been a globe-trotter as a coach. How do you see the ILT20 growing?

ILT20: Six teams, new captains, old excitement

ILT20 has its first player auction this year. How much do you think a fiery Shane Bond could have bagged?

Your career was ravaged by injuries. As a fast-bowling coach, what's your advice to tearaway fast bowlers like Mayank Yadav and Umran Malik, who are battling injuries every now and then?

Poll Do you think the rise of T20 leagues has complicated the careers of fast bowlers? Yes, due to workload No, it's a good opportunity Only for smaller nations

Has cricket become more difficult for fast bowlers with three formats and multiple leagues?

Are you someone who tells young fast bowlers to play more first-class cricket to improve?

If a 20-year-old quick aims to play 12–13 years at the top, how can he manage his workload today?

Former New Zealand speedster and Gulf Giants bowling coach Shane Bond reflects on ILT20’s growth, its unique blend of global and local talent, and the challenges of coaching in a multicultural environment. In a free-wheeling chat with the TimesofIndia.com Bond opens up about fast-bowling workloads, modern leagues, injury management, and why grounding in first-class cricket still matters.It's great, mate. I mean, I did the first season here, so it's nice to come back to it. I think it's a unique league because you have so many different overseas players from different countries, and obviously you've got the local players. That's the part that I really enjoy — just seeing the local players get the opportunity to play in the league. So I think it's the responsibility of cricket communities to bring a whole lot of different countries up, and this is a league that's definitely helping those UAE players.For me as a coach, it's also a little bit more challenging because you're dealing with things like language, culture, trying to bring people together.And so it gets you to think about your own coaching and how you go about it. I mean, it's invigorating.Mind you, I played the IPL for a year (laughs).So I got the whole auction experience, which was really exciting. And then after that, I remember sitting in rooms with Corey Anderson and Trent Boult when they went for really good money, and that was really exciting as well. So I think every time there's an IPL auction, someone does extremely well out of it. There's been a whole heap of Kiwis that I've known who have done that. You get super excited for them.I don't look back and go, what if, or whatever. That's not my time now. It's just the way it goes. I'm just lucky that I get the chance to work alongside the players. I'm still involved in cricket — in a job in cricket. I'm very lucky to have that.So every time that auction comes up, I think everyone's always wanting to know who's going to go for the big money, who's going to go where. And as I said, there are not too many bad people in cricket. So the people who do get a big payday and have a life-changing experience — it's pretty cool to see that.The biggest thing you've got to remember when you're going through 18 to 24 is that your body's still growing. Your bones are still growing — all that sort of stuff. So what's the tendency? If you get someone who's exciting and bowls fast, you just want to play them all the time. And the reality is, if you do that, they're going to break.So management and how you manage those bowlers is really important. And I think that's the thing — going, okay, are we prepared to rest this player, give them some time to condition, and actually not play them in every game? Because they're going to break.And I think you look at a guy like Pat Cummins — he missed five years. When they brought him back, they brought him back through one-day cricket. He’d grown bigger, stronger. They eased him back in. And then he's had this incredible career that people sort of forget included those five years he missed.So I think it's a combination. Some people have more durability than others — that's just natural. I think sometimes the management has just got to get a little bit better. When players get fit, there's one thing — being fit for cricket — but sometimes players, especially good players, get fit and you just throw them straight back into top-level cricket. You don't give them the chance to ease through club cricket or second-level cricket — just to get some time and overs under the body and create a bit more durability. There's a tendency to rush those players back, and as soon as you rush someone back and the intensity goes up, the risk of injury goes up.It depends on what format you're playing. I think that's one of the challenges if you're playing all formats. It's obviously become more lucrative. I think it's been more of a challenge maybe for the smaller countries. If you look at Australia, India, and England, they pay a lot of money. Their fast bowlers tend to stay. The classic examples are Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Pat Cummins — they've played for Australia for a long time.For Kiwis, you look at Lockie Ferguson, Adam Milne to some degree. Because you're not getting paid at the same level, you now have the opportunity to step away from your national team. New Zealand have had to juggle that, and I think they've juggled it pretty well.If you're given the opportunity to make ten times as much money to bowl a quarter of the overs, it's hard not to take that up — particularly with the injury risk that Test cricket presents. The more overs you bowl, the more chance you have of getting hurt. I think it's just a different time. T20 leagues have taken over, and you can't blame people for wanting to maximise their earning potential. And to be fair, when you jump around the world — going to South Africa, Dubai, Australia, doing all this stuff — it's pretty cool. It's good fun. You can't blame people for doing that.I tell them it's their decision. I can advise, but it's not my choice. My job is to support. I think there's something to be said about a grounding in first-class cricket. Obviously, the more you bowl — if you can stay fit — with proper management, you learn to groove your technique and understand your technique. I think that's no different to a batter. You understand how to bat, how to bat time, what works, what doesn't. If you're playing the longer form of cricket, it can help that.I think you've seen players step away from long-form cricket and then sometimes step back because they realise they just need that time. You definitely need that grounding in longer-form cricket. Even in short-form cricket, the ability to put the ball on the spot, hit the top of the stumps consistently — it translates across formats. Then all the variations feed off that.I think you've seen that in the IPL a little bit. You've got these young guys who've come on the scene — they bowl quick, but without control, it doesn't matter. Whereas the Hazlewoods of the world have come in, hit the top of off stump, worked on their variations, and are now awesome T20 bowlers. There's something to be said about understanding how to hit the top of off stump consistently all day.He’ll play for four or five different teams with coaches who all have different expectations. I think the biggest thing as a coach is to ask: what is in the best interest of this player? It's not about me winning the title — it's about how I look after this player and get him to where I think he can go.You sit down with that player and go, this is what I think is best for you. How do we get you here fully fit? If I do that, and he stays on the park longer, he'll have a long, successful career — and as a coach, I'll probably get the benefit of that too.Look, it's challenging. Every player is different; they go through different experiences. But one thing I think is that as a coach, you have a duty of care to look after a player and do whatever you can to help them stay on the field.","Former New Zealand speedster and Gulf Giants bowling coach Shane Bond reflects on ILT20’s growth, its unique blend of global and local talent.

Iranian defender Amirmahan Afrooziani’s attempt to connect with it failed, and as he fell down, India midfielder Gunleiba Wangkheirakpam, lurking on the left flank, took two touches before unleashing a fierce shot that took the deflection of Mohammad Ali Rahnama before landing in the Iranian goal. The goal sparked wild, delirious celebrations on the Indian bench, and Gunleiba was cautioned for his shirtless celebration.India still needed to keep Iran at bay for more than 40 minutes, and they defended with composure and rare resoluteness.

Alexander Isak scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool, leading to a crucial 2-0 victory against West Ham at the London Stadium on Sunday.The Sweden forward had not scored in five Premier League appearances since his British record £125 million transfer from Newcastle in September.This was only Isak's second goal in 11 matches across all competitions for Liverpool, following his initial score in a League Cup victory against Southampton.Liverpool secured their first win in four games when Cody Gakpo added a second goal during stoppage time.""There's definitely a feeling of relief because if you have lost so many times, then winning is important. We hardly conceded a chance and we were able to create chances ourselves,"" Reds boss Arne Slot said.""It helps if you don't go 1-0 down after five minutes because then you are more open. We played the game I wanted us to play. What I saw meant a lot to our players and our fans. This is a good first step for us. We won and had a clean sheet.""Isak's performance had been affected by injuries and lack of match fitness after missing pre-season due to his extended transfer negotiations.The 26-year-old's goal marked his first league score since playing for Newcastle against Brighton in May, ending a 10-match goalless streak for both club and country.""I think it does feel significant,"" Slot said.Liverpool had faced recent challenges, including a 4-1 defeat against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League and 3-0 losses to Manchester City and Nottingham Forest.The team had lost nine of their previous 12 games, marking their worst performance since 1953-54, including six defeats in seven league matches.The victory helped Liverpool move to eighth place, providing relief for Slot who faced mounting pressure.Mohamed Salah's performance has been a concern, with only five goals this season, leading to his third bench placement.West Ham honored their former captain and manager Billy Bonds, who passed away at 79, with a minute's applause.Despite West Ham's strong start, Liverpool gradually took control of the match.Isak initially struggled, missing a clear chance from the edge of the area and having a bicycle kick saved by Alphonse Areola.The Swedish striker finally scored after 60 minutes, converting Gakpo's assist with a low shot past Areola.Isak was substituted shortly after scoring, receiving acknowledgment from Slot on the sideline.West Ham's situation worsened when Lucas Paqueta received a red card in the 84th minute for two yellow cards, both for dissent against referee Darren England.The match concluded with Gakpo scoring from 12 yards following a defensive error by West Ham.","Liverpool defeated West Ham 2-0 at the London Stadium on Sunday.

Joshua Zirkzee scored his first Premier League goal in nearly a year, while Mason Mount secured the winning goal as Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 on Sunday.Ruben Amorim's team initially fell behind when Jean-Philippe Mateta scored a first-half penalty at Selhurst Park. However, Zirkzee and Mount's second-half goals helped United secure their first victory in four matches.United overcame their slow start with Zirkzee's first Premier League goal since his strike against Everton in December 2024. The Dutch striker had experienced a 24-game goalless streak in the league, raising questions about his £36 million transfer from Bologna in 2024.Zirkzee, aged 24, had not found the net in his previous eight appearances since April. Mount, who has faced injury setbacks since joining from Chelsea, celebrated only his second goal of the season.This victory marked United's first win since October, providing relief for Amorim after their recent loss to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The win was particularly significant as it ended Palace's unbeaten home record in the Premier League, which had stood since February 15.""There are no excuses"" for United's struggling start to the season, Amorim had stated earlier in the week.Casemiro nearly gave United an early lead within the first minute when a long throw created confusion in Palace's defense, but Dean Henderson saved his close-range shot.Mateta missed an opportunity at the other end, failing to score after getting past Leny Yoro with only goalkeeper Senne Lammens to beat. Lammens then made saves from Daichi Kamada's low shot and helped defend against Yeremy Pino's attempt.Palace took the lead in the 36th minute through a penalty. Yoro fouled Mateta, who initially scored but had his goal disallowed for a double-touch violation.A new rule implemented this season allows successful penalties with accidental double-touches to be retaken. This rule clarification followed Julian Alvarez's disallowed penalty for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid last season.Mateta successfully converted his second attempt past Lammens. Zirkzee, who had been quiet in the first half, equalized in the 54th minute with a remarkable shot from a difficult angle after receiving Bruno Fernandes' free-kick.Shortly after scoring, Zirkzee almost contributed to an own goal when he deflected the ball toward his own net, but it was cleared to safety.Mount put United ahead in the 63rd minute, scoring from a free-kick assist by Fernandes. His low shot went under the Palace wall and past Henderson from 20 yards out.",Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.

KOLKATA: Khalid Jamil seems to have a quick fix for stemming the rot in the Indian national football team — bringing more Ryan Williams-like Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) players to the table.Jamil’s stint with the Blue Tigers began with a creditable third-place finish in their maiden CAFA Nations Cup but it turned out to be false dawn earlier than anticipated with India failing to make the Asian Cup final round with back-to-back losses to Singapore and Bangladesh.“We need more OCI players like Williams in the national team,” Jamil said during an interaction with mediapersons on Saturday. “One or two more such players have been shortlisted and we’ll reveal their names once everything is confirmed. I feel it’s a good chance. It would be better if we have more Indian overseas players with Indian passport. If he’s available and playing outside, it would be very good. It would definitely improve our performance. In the last game (against Bangladesh) had Ryan Williams been there, we could have performed better,” Jamil remarked.After relinquishing his Australian passport to become an Indian citizen, Williams travelled to Dhaka as a member of Jamil’s squad but could not play because of the delay in getting the mandatory Fifa approval with respect to the change of member association.",Jamil’s stint with the Blue Tigers began with a creditable third-place finish in their maiden CAFA Nations Cup but it turned out to be false dawn earlier than anticipated.

Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano showered praise on Lionel Messi , calling him “extraordinary”, after the Argentine icon guided the club into their maiden MLS Cup final with a commanding 5-1 victory over New York City FC on Saturday.Miami’s charge to the championship match was led by a brilliant Tadeo Allende hat-trick, while Mateo Silvetti and Telasco Segovia also found the net in a dominant performance at Fort Lauderdale.Messi, 38, didn’t score on the night, but produced a moment of pure class when he set up Silvetti for Miami’s third goal. That assist came just as New York were closing in on an equaliser and effectively put the contest to bed.Mascherano, who previously shared the pitch with Messi for Barcelona and Argentina, said his star man continues to redefine what is possible.“Leo has spoiled us with the extraordinary,” Mascherano said. “He is unique, someone we won’t see again. Maybe people expected a goal today, but he brought calmness with that third goal. Only he can spot that pass. It basically ended the match.”Miami will now welcome either San Diego FC or the Vancouver Whitecaps, who face off later on Saturday, in next weekend’s MLS Cup final.The team enters the title clash in peak form, having smashed FC Cincinnati 4-0 in the previous round and now dismantling New York with similar ruthlessness.Allende was at the centre of Miami’s attacking storm once again. The 26-year-old struck first in the 14th minute after beating the offside trap, then doubled the lead with an outstanding header shortly after.New York responded through Justin Haak’s headed effort in the 37th minute and almost levelled when Julian Fernandez drew a superb save from Rocco Rios Novo in the 66th minute.That moment proved pivotal. Miami instantly countered, with Rodrigo De Paul and Jordi Alba combining before Messi threaded a perfectly weighted pass to Silvetti, who fired home for 3-1.Segovia made it 4-1 in the 83rd minute, and Allende completed his hat-trick a minute later, setting off huge celebrations.Mascherano credited the squad for turning around a season that once looked in disarray.“The players deserve the praise. They understood the direction we needed to take,” he said. “We grew stronger together and reached this stage with a real sense of unity. Everyone pulls in the same direction, and who starts doesn’t matter. The strength of this group is unshakeable.”",Inter Miami beat New York City FC 5-1 in MLS Eastern Conference final.

Tom Brady reflects on family, Michigan memories and moments that meant the most



Also read:

Tom Brady may be busy with his FOX duties these days, but his Thanksgiving break proved he still treasures the quieter moments. Instead of rushing between stadiums, he headed back to Michigan for a long weekend that looked more personal than anything fans have seen from him recently. His Instagram carousel on Monday told the whole story, starting with a photo of him wrapped around his daughter, Vivian, on the Michigan field and another of his sons, Jack and Benjamin, proudly showing off their Wolverines gear during the rivalry matchup with Ohio State. It was the kind of update that immediately stood out to fans who are used to seeing Brady in constant work mode.This shift toward family time also connects back to what Brady once revealed about the strain his schedule created at home. In 2020, he spoke about a heartfelt letter Gisele Bündchen wrote to him, explaining that he wasn’t contributing enough because he was constantly working. As Brady put it, “She didn’t feel I was doing my part for the family,” a wake-up call that made him reevaluate how he handled his career and personal life.Tom Brady's visit turned into a full family reunion, with his parents, Galynn and Tom Brady Sr., joining him, along with his niece Maya Brady, who has made a name for herself as a softball star at UCLA.Brady had already worked the Lions-Packers game on Thanksgiving for FOX, but once that was done, he made sure to get to Ann Arbor in time to soak up the holiday with the people closest to him.Brady summed up the trip with a message that struck a warm note. It read, “What a special Thanksgiving weekend with the people I love most!” He described the mood of the holiday, adding, “Laughing, playing, eating too much… and enjoying our family and football and tradition in the state of Michigan."" He also joked about how relaxed campus life feels now, saying that visiting without worrying about finals, “is always such a special experience. ”The post included more photos, including a stop to watch Maya play volleyball for Michigan and a reunion with former teammates like Rob Gronkowski. Brady also shared a picture with FOX colleagues Dean Blandino, Kevin Burkhardt, Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi, showing a bit of the work side of his trip. One line stood out for fans: he called making Michigan memories with his kids “a dream come true.”He closed with a message that felt especially heartfelt which read, “Surrounded by the love of my parents means the world to me… Sending my love to you all and gratitude and I hope you all had an incredible Thanksgiving as well. Even the people in Columbus.”","Tom Brady spent Thanksgiving in Michigan with his family. He shared photos of the trip on his Instagram.

Fans were already talking about Bad Bunny headlining the Halftime Show, but the addition of Charlie Puth Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones has pushed excitement even higher. The mix of pop, R&B and powerhouse vocals gives the league a wide range of star appeal for one of the biggest TV nights of the year. The lineup reveal also arrived during a season where the NFL has been taking bigger swings with its music choices. With the game scheduled for February 8, 2026 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, the league seems set on creating a pregame show that covers multiple genres and audiences. While many fans have praised the lineup, the decision has also drawn criticism from conservative commentators who object to having a Spanish-language performer during President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.Charlie Puth, 33, will perform the national anthem. He is known for hits like ""Attention,"" ""We Don’t Talk Anymore"" and ""See You Again,"" and has racked up more than 35 billion streams worldwide. His Super Bowl appearance will come shortly before his next album, Whatever's Clever!, which arrives in March 2026.Brandi Carlile will take on ""America the Beautiful."" The singer, 44, has earned eleven Grammy Awards and is widely recognized for her powerful voice and songwriting. She is also an Oscar nominee, two time Emmy winner and bestselling author. Her latest album, Returning to Myself, follows her Grammy-nominated collaboration with Elton John titled Who Believes in Angels?Meanwhile, Coco Jones rounds out the pregame set with a performance of ""Lift Every Voice and Sing.""Jones, 27, won the 2024 Grammy for Best R&B Performance for her platinum single ""ICU"" and now stars as Hilary Banks on Peacock’s Bel Air.NFL executive Jon Barker praised the lineup, saying, ""Super Bowl Sunday is the world’s biggest entertainment stage, and we’re proud to spotlight artists who embody the very best of music and culture."" Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez added, ""Charlie, Brandi and Coco are generational talents.""This year’s show will also feature ASL performances from Fred Beam and Julian Ortiz, along with a historic multilingual signing of the Halftime Show led by Celimar Rivera Cosme. Bad Bunny, announced earlier as the Halftime performer, shared his excitement, saying, ""What I'm feeling goes beyond myself… Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.""","Brandi Carlile, Charlie Puth and Coco Jones will perform at Super Bowl LX.

Why did the Giants bench Abdul Carter again? The rookie’s repeated tardiness and team-rule violations raise fresh concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-the-giants-bench-abdul-carter-again-the-rookies-repeated-tardiness-and-team-rule-violations-raise-fresh-concerns/articleshow/125708477.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Why was Abdul Carter benched?

When Abdul Carter opened the game on the bench, it immediately raised eyebrows because it fit a pattern many inside the New York Giants building have been talking about. Carter already had a similar moment two weeks earlier when he sat out the first series against the Green Bay Packers after missing a walk-through that insiders described as part of a rookie year trend. At the time, he told ESPN it was an honest mistake and blamed a treatment schedule mix up, brushing aside talk of oversleeping.Still, that incident happened under the shadow of a 1 9 start that cost Brian Daboll his job, and several players privately shared that discipline had slipped throughout the season. Once Mike Kafka stepped in as interim head coach in November, things shifted quickly. So when ESPN reported that Carter’s latest absence was simply a coach’s decision, it matched Kafka’s early push to tighten up expectations. Reports cited by CBS Sports noted that Carter had missed all or part of another team responsibility before kickoff. With the Giants stuck in a six game skid and riding a 12 game road losing streak, it feels like Kafka is trying to reset the entire culture. Carter’s benching was just the most visible sign.ESPN sideline reporter shared the details during the broadcast, stating that sources had informed her the absence was classified as a ""coach's decision"" and not related to any injury.Interim head coach Mike Kafka later confirmed the disciplinary nature of the move but kept specifics internal, telling reporters postgame, ""It's a coach's decision,"" without elaborating further on the infraction.Reports from The New York Post, cited by CBS Sports, indicated that Carter had missed all or part of another team responsibility leading into the game, echoing the reason for his prior benching.This came amid a broader team context: The Giants entered the matchup on a six-game losing streak, including 12 straight road defeats dating back to the previous season, and Kafka, hired last month after the firing of head coach Brian Daboll, has emphasized accountability as a core principle in his early tenure. Several Giants players have noted to ESPN that lapses in discipline contributed to the team's 2-9 record through 12 games.Also Read: Quinshon Judkins injury update: Cleveland Browns’ star slams his head forcing an exit",Abdul Carter was benched for the first series of the New York Giants game against the Green Bay Packers.

Cardi B and Stefon Diggs net worth comparison





New England’s Stefon Diggs is known for his stardom on the football field, as he has been one of the most productive wide receivers in the NFL for the last decade, but lately, his life off the gridiron has stirred just as much attention. The Patriots wideout is now dating superstar rapper Cardi B , and the two recently welcomed their first baby. Fans are fascinated by the pairing, not only for their celebrity status but also for the question everyone asks. Which half of the couple has the higher net worth?Patriots' Stefon Diggs just kicked off his 11th NFL season, and his first with the New England Patriots, after signing a three-year, $63.5 million contract this offseason. He has long been among the league’s elite wide receivers, with a career defined by consistent performance, steady leadership, and major paydays. In total, Diggs has made $155.8 million in career earnings. According to Celebrity Net Worth, his net worth is listed at $60 million, a massive number. But does it rival his girlfriend’s?Cardi B began her rise in the early 2010s, using social media as her launchpad before stepping into Love and Hip Hop: New York in 2015.That exposure helped shape her brand, but it was music that sent her into global recognition. They signed with Atlantic Records in 2017 and released “Bodak Yellow”, which became her defining breakthrough. The track hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and shifted her from rising artist to mainstream star. She has only grown since then, earning 10 Grammy nominations and winning one for Best Rap Album in 2019 for her album, “Invasion of Privacy.” According to Celebrity Net Worth, her net worth is listed at $80 million, beating out her boyfriend by $20 million.The numbers reveal a striking contrast in how each built their fortune. Diggs relies mainly on his NFL contracts, bonuses, and performance incentives. Cardi B has multiple revenue streams. Her music, brand partnerships, touring potential, digital presence, and entrepreneurial endeavors allow her wealth to expand beyond any single category. While Cardi B has a roughly $20 million net worth lead, both stand among the rare personalities whose achievements transcend their industries. Together, the power couple share an impressive combined net worth of around $140 million. Whether by sharp lyricism or precise route running, both continue to shape culture, success, and influence in their own style.Also Read: ""He was going to kill me"": Titans’ Julius Chestnut drops bombshell accusation that Jaguars punter Cooke threatened to kill him during intense Sunday clash","Cardi B and Stefon Diggs have a combined net worth of around $140 million.

Tennessee Titans running back Julius Chestnut and the Cooke confrontation



Tennessee Titans running back Julius Chestnut was taken off guard by Jacksonville Jaguars punter Logan Cooke’s intense and emotional threat during Sunday’s matchup. The moment followed a bruising hit that briefly sidelined Cooke for a concussion evaluation, setting off a spark of volatile tensions. What unfolded next was not the usual trash talk. As Chestnut recalled to reporters, Cooke got close and, in his words, “said he was going to kill” him. The young Titans back shared it with a half-smile, still visibly perplexed by what he had heard. “I was just trying to play hard, and he came up to me and said he was going to kill me,” Chestnut said. “So I don’t know what made him do that.”The unexpected hostility was even stranger given that such outbursts from a punter are virtually unheard of. Chestnut added, “That was surprising to me. I ain't never seen nothing like that before.” He said he did not receive any follow-up clarification or apology from Cooke after the incident.This was not an isolated flare-up, but one scene in a broader storm between both teams. Cooke, who stands 6 feet 5 and weighs 230 pounds, is not a passive specialist. He absorbed multiple collisions during Jacksonville’s 25-3 win, including the block from Chestnut on Chimere Dike’s 47-yard return.That block sent Cooke to the turf, where he remained for concussion evaluation before returning and continuing to punt through visible frustrations.Cooke did speak after the game, but reporters never directly asked him about the alleged death threat. He instead addressed his heated interactions with Titans players and a discussion with a referee at halftime. ""I might have said some things that sounded rude, so I wanted to go clear the air,"" Cooke said. He explained that he wanted no grudges left hanging and added that emotions can escalate quickly “in the moment” during certain calls. “But it is what it is,” Cooke said. “You can’t hold that against them.”Jaguars coach Liam Coen acknowledged the emotional undercurrent that fueled Cooke’s reactions, citing the pressure of aggressive punt rushes and the challenges of working with a backup long snapper. “There were some frustrations being built up with them rushing us the way they were,” Coen said. “I’m proud of those guys for competing, but we’ve got to continue to be smarter.”In the end, the scoreboard showed a decisive Jaguars victory. The emotional fallout told a much more revealing story of rivalry, adrenaline, and human unpredictability on the field.Also Read: While Drake Maye prepares for Giants, his wife Ann’s Patriots-themed cookies become unexpected pre-game sensation","Tennessee Titans running back Julius Chestnut reveals he was threatened with death on the field by Jaguars punter Logan Cooke.

Landry Kiffin’s response triggers new wave of reaction





Landry Kiffin (Tiktok)

The scene around Lane Kiffin’s move to LSU already felt tense, but the spotlight has quickly shifted toward his daughter, Landry Kiffin. Her reaction to the backlash from Ole Miss fans has turned into its own headline, adding a personal layer to what was already a high emotion coaching departure. On the day Lane Kiffin was officially introduced as the head coach of the LSU Tigers, Landry took a shot at the angry Ole Miss Rebels faithful who have not handled the breakup quietly.Lane Kiffin’s exit from Mississippi ends a six season run that saw him build a genuine connection in Oxford. Landry herself attended school there and was even the emotional anchor that kept her father from leaving for Auburn in 2022. Yet on Monday, LSU rolled out the purple and gold carpet and made it official. Lane also admitted during his LSU press conference that “the last 48 hours sucked” and that he understands the wave of emotions from Ole Miss fans who watched him board that private jet toward a new chapter.Landry Kiffin's presence around Ole Miss football had always been friendly and popular. Fans loved her all white game day looks and the family atmosphere around her, mom Layla and Knox. That image shifted this season when she publicly confirmed her relationship with LSU star linebacker Whit Weeks right before Ole Miss faced LSU.She even skipped several of her dad’s games to attend Weeks’ instead, wearing LSU themed looks, including her white tiger style at Alabama. Photos even showed her in custom LSU gear, which already hinted that her loyalty was drifting.There were more breadcrumbs. She reportedly showed up at an LSU booster event last week before the news broke. Then, while Ole Miss fans in Oxford were venting and airing their bitterness, Landry was in Nashville at a friend’s birthday party filming TikTok dances. She even missed the Egg Bowl and Knox’s playoff game. After the LSU announcement, her first post was a sarcastic jab at the critics where she wrote, “Wish I could be as creative as angry football fans 🫶🏻“ followed by the hashtag “#itsnotthatdeep. ”Oxford once embraced the Kiffins as family. Now the relationship feels fractured. However, based on Landry’s attitude, she seems ready to trade Mississippi awkwardness for Baton Rouge acceptance.Also Read: Why Giants rookie Jaxson Dart wears eye black and a signature chain every time he takes the field?

Jaxson Dart 's necklace: The deeper meaning behind a Giants good luck charm





Jaxson Dart's necklace sparkles during every New York Giants game, but beneath the bright stadium lights, it stands for something far more personal. This small piece of jewelry has been with him through bowl games, draft day expectations, and now the roaring NFL stage. It is never just part of his outfit. It is a ritual, a reminder, a heartbeat from home woven into every snap and every throw.He takes the field with confidence, toughness, and real emotion. It is a demanding job to step into the spotlight as a rookie quarterback in New York, but Dart brings a piece of family faith to steady him in every moment. That little chain carries a lot of heart.When asked about the necklace, Jaxson Dart explains it openly. ""I haven't missed a game with it. I make sure it's one of the first things that I pack,"" Dart said. For him, it is not crafted from diamonds or forged by luxury jewelers. It is something much more meaningful. It came from his sister.He still remembers the moment he first picked it up. ""I remember I was walking out the door, and I was just grabbing my headphones, whatever it may be on the table, and I saw this necklace,"" he said. ""I looked at it and I was like, dang, I like that necklace. I asked my mom, I said, 'Whose is it?' And she's like it's your sister's.""That day, he wore it into a college bowl game and threw four touchdowns.From then on, it became tradition. ""It started out because I felt like it looked cool, you know, during the games. And that was kind of a swag piece that I'd put together each game day,"" he said. ""It's a good luck charm for sure. But at the same time, it's a cool thing between me and my sister.""Through every rough tackle and every triumphant first down, it stays with him. ""I try to do my best to adjust it if it's kind of messed up when I come back on the sideline,"" Dart said. ""It's definitely held its own because I've taken a lot of hits.""The hearts on the chain are not real gemstones, but they might as well be priceless. ""It's definitely very valuable to me, because like I said, it's a relationship thing between me and my sister,"" Dart said. Then he shared the meaning that goes beyond football. ""I've kind of thought of it as a deeper meaning to love all that you're around ... a special reminder that we live in a world where maybe not everybody agrees with everybody's opinion. I think that's kind of the beauty of our identity as people. But at the same time, I think it's important to share love and bring people together. So that's just kind of like the emoji of a heart, bringing people together and kind of spreading joy and love to all.""In a league full of glare and glitter, Jaxson Dart reminds us that the most powerful symbols are not worn for show. They are carried from home, from family, and from the people who held belief long before the world ever did.Also Read: While Drake Maye prepares for Giants, his wife Ann’s Patriots-themed cookies become unexpected pre-game sensation","New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart wears a necklace during every game.

However, the NFL is expanding its pregame entertainment, not altering the halftime headliner.

NFL Stands Firm On Bad Bunny's 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show Despite MAGA Fury

Bad Bunny remains the headliner as the NFL expands the overall musical experience

The road to Super Bowl LX has become unexpectedly dramatic, not because of football, but because of fan speculation. When Charlie Puth posted his excited message on X, “I can’t believe I’m saying this… I will be performing the National Anthem at Super Bowl LX”, many casual followers mistakenly interpreted it as him stepping into a larger role.That misunderstanding quickly snowballed into rumors that Bad Bunny had been pulled from the halftime broadcast or replaced entirely. The misunderstanding grew in part because the pregame lineup features high-profile artists, and the recent addition of Coco Jones and Brandi Carlile only amplified chatter. But beneath the noise, the NFL ’s original halftime headliner decision hasn’t changed.What’s really happening is not a shake-up, it’s an expansion. The NFL is clearly moving toward a more diversified entertainment slate, turning the Super Bowl into a layered concert-style broadcast before a single snap of the ball.Puth will headline the national anthem, Jones will deliver “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” and Carlile will perform “America the Beautiful,” while ASL sign artists Fred Beam and Julian Ortiz ensure inclusive representation. This wide music spectrum builds anticipation differently than in previous years, carving out a full-day cultural showcase rather than a singular halftime spectacle.Meanwhile, Bad Bunny’s halftime role is untouched and it’s intentional. The NFL knows he brings both global reach and passionate fandom, especially among younger audiences and Latino viewers. Even earlier backlash from certain political pundits following his September announcement did not shift the league’s direction. If anything, the rumors unintentionally spotlighted the growing cultural footprint of the halftime show and Bad Bunny’s central place in it.Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium is shaping up to be less about substitution and more about celebration. Puth isn’t replacing Bad Bunny, he’s complementing him. The overall approach suggests this year’s production wants to appeal simultaneously to pop fans, R&B listeners, Americana audiences, and a cross-national demographic that extends past traditional NFL spectators.Instead of one defining performance, viewers will be treated to a full spectrum of sounds, culminating with Bad Bunny still owning the halftime stage.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras docuseries faces fan backlash as Travis Kelce’s presence takes center stage","Fan speculation about Super Bowl LX's musical lineup, fueled by Charlie Puth's anthem announcement, mistakenly suggested Bad Bunny was replaced.

She finished off her “Bakemas” Patriots M&M chocolate chip cookies and they look scrumptious. Some viewers even joked that the cookie colors looked like Giants colors. Just saying.The couple’s connection runs deep. Drake was a superstar for UNC before he became the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft to New England. Ann Michael also went to college with Maye, and her brother Tad even played QB with Maye. They got married just this past June 21 back in North Carolina.The relationship between the rising NFL star and his supportive wife adds a grounded layer to the Patriots narrative.

Dillon Brooks Imitates Lebron James’s Celebration

Suns Snapped Lakers' Winning Streak

Also Read:

The Los Angeles vs. Phoenix Suns match took a dramatic turn when Dillon Brooks lit up the arena with a dunk and followed it by imitating LeBron James ’s signature celebration.Brooks’ playing style is defined by aggression and intensity that doesn’t shy away from any physical battles. He is an offensive powerhouse who can shoot from the arc or finish at the rim, but it is his defense that shaped his resume. And he followed the same pattern when he faced the Lakers on Monday.The Phoenix Suns travelled all the way to the Crypto.com Arena to face the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday. The Lakers were coming off a 133-121 win over the Pelicans, whereas the Suns faced back-to-back losses against the Thunder (119-123) and the Nuggets (112-130).The Suns started strong against the Lakers and finished the first quarter on a tie with 31 points each, but the 2nd quarter was another story. The Suns dominated it and finished with a 14-point lead, going into halftime with 66-52. But it was the last 35 seconds where the feud was escalated by Brooks.Luka Doncic threw an air ball, and Suns’ Royce O’Neale caught it and threw a long pass to Dillon Brooks all the way from one end to the other, assisting him in a dominating dunk.LeBron James tried to intercept the pass but failed, resulting in Brooks finishing with 23 points in the first half. But what grabbed attention was Brooks' imitation of James’ celebration post the dunk.In a video posted by Duane Rankin on X, Brooks, about his interaction with LeBron James, said, “I’m a competitor man. I don’t really like the smiling, the giggling and all that. Just letting him know I’m here and I’m still rising.” He added, “He likes people that bow down. I don’t bow down. That either entices him or it aggravates him, either one.”The Suns' 125-108 dominant victory over the Lakers broke more than hearts. It shattered the Lakers' 7-game winning streak, stopping them at the 2nd position in the Western Conference with 15-5. Dillon Brooks recorded 33 points, 2 rebounds, and 2 assists with 15 field goals and 2 three pointers made. Whereas Lebron James only had 10 points, 3 assists, with no rebounds recorded over 31 minutes on the court.This loss highlighted several voids in the Lakers’ bench and should serve as a wake up call if they wish to win another championship. They will travel all the way to the Scotiabank Arena for their next match against the Toronto Raptors. The Houston Rockets will host the Suns at the Toyota Center for their next meet-up.","The Phoenix Suns beat the Los Angeles Lakers 125-108 on Monday.
