Support is at $4160/$4100. Intermediate resistance is at $4245/$4300. (AI image)

Gold price prediction

:

Gold prices are likely to rise in the near-term, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan. The analyst shares his views on gold and silver price outlook and what levels investors should watch out for:

Gold Performance: Huge weekly gain

On December 1, spot gold traded between $4206 and $4264. The yellow metal at the time of writing this article was trading nearly 0.2% lower at $4230.

The MCX February gold contract at Rs 130,499 was up by 0.77%.

In the week ending November 28, the metal surged 4.25% for the week.

As the Fed leaders including the Governor Waller and NY Fed President Willaims have called for December rate cut, rate cut probability has surged sharply. Kevin Hassett emerging as the leading candidate for the Fed Chair post has further boosted easy monetary policy expectations in near future as he is closely aligned with Trump's economic policies and has called for rate cuts.

Gold advanced for the fourth straight month in November as it registered a gain of 5.75% for the month.

ETF holdings and COMEX inventory: ETF holdings rise

Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 97.503 MOz as of November 28, the highest level since October 30 and roughly around 3-year high. Holdings rose 0.20 MOz (6.22 tons) in the week ending November 28.

Eligible COMEX gold inventory at 18.2 MOz is down by 18.75% from the cycle peak of 22.45 MOz noted on April 14 in the wake of Trump's 'Liberation Day'. Total COMEX gold inventory stands at 36.35 MOz, down 19.34% from the record peak of 45.07 MOz reached on April 4.

Goldman Sachs gold survey: 36% see gold topping $5K

Data roundup: US and Chinese data weak

S&P Global US manufacturing PMI final data released on December 1 at 52.20 topped the forecast of 51.90 (prior 51.9). However, US ISM manufacturing PMI fell from 48.70 in October to 48.20 in November Vs the forecast of 49 as ISM prices paid rose from 58 to 58.50. ISM manufacturing Index fell to one-year low as manufacturing contracted for the ninth consecutive month. New orders shrank and lagged the forecast., while ISM employment fell to 3-month low of 44 and contracted faster than the forecast 46.

US ADP reported that for the four weeks ending Nov. 8, 2025, private US employers shed an average of 13,500 jobs/week.

China’s official NBS Manufacturing declined for the eighth straight month in November: Although the PMI increased from 49 in October to 49.20, matching the forecast, it remained stuck in the contraction zone. China’s NBS nonmanufacturing PMI came in at 49.50 in November Vs the forecast of 50 (prior 50.10), while China’s RatingDog manufacturing PMI unexpectedly contracted as the PMI came in at 49.90 Vs the estimate of 50.50

US data released last week were mostly disappointing/soft. The Fed Beige book reflected soft consumer spending and a cooling labour market. University of Michigan sentiment came in at 51 in its November final reading, remaining around record low, though inflation expectations eased. US Retail sales advance rose by 0.2% m-o-m in September Vs the forecast of 0.4%. Retail sales control group unexpectedly contracted. PPI final demand was up by 0.3% m-o-m in September that matched the estimate (prior -0.1%) but core PPI increased by 0.1% Vs the forecast of 0.2% (prior -0.1%). Conference Board Consumer Confidence fell from 95.50 in October to 88.70 in November, the lowest since April.

US Dollar Index and yields: Dollar under pressure

Geopolitics watch: Venezuela also in focus

A US delegation led by President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff will start negotiations over the Ukraine war this week. The situation remains tense as EU's diplomats have expressed concerns that the US may push Ukraine into a skewed peace plan with Russia which may ultimately encourage Russia's war mongering.

US President Trump will hold a meeting tonight on next steps on Venezuela. On November 30, President Donald Trump said airlines should consider the airspace above and around Venezuela to be closed while he pushes for more aggressive steps against President Nicolas Maduro’s government.

December Fed rate cut probability: Almost certain

Upcoming data and events: Focus on ADP, ISM services and PCE Price Index

Major US data on tap this week include ADP employment change (Dec. 3), ISM services (Dec. 3), Import and export price indices (Dec. 3), ISM services (Dec. 3), weekly job report (Dec. 4), PCE Price Index (Dec. 5) and University of Michigan sentiment and inflation expectations (Dec. 5).

European data include Eurozone's unemployment rate (Dec. 2), CPI (Dec. 2), services and composite PMIs (Dec. 3) and 3Q third GDP reading and 3Q final employment reading (Dec. 5). UK's services and composite PMIs will be released on Dec. 3 respectively.

Fed Chair Powell will speak briefly on George Shultz and his economic policy contribution at Memorial Event on Dec. 2.

Michelle Bowman, Vice Chair for Supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, will testify before the House Committee on Dec. 2 and will speak on Bank Supervision and regulation on Dec. 4.

Gold Price Outlook

: Positive

Spot gold is expected to rise further on the Fed rate cut expectations and economic concerns as PMIs out of China and the US disappoint.

Vanke, a leading Chinese property developer, has asked for a 12-month extension to pay its 2 billion yuan note originally due on Dec. 15 along with interest. China Real Estate Information Corp. and China Index Academy withheld monthly home sales figures of the nation’s 100 largest developers for November on Sunday.

Gold may reach all-time high of $4381 in near-term. Support is at $4160/$4100. Intermediate resistance is at $4245/$4300.

Silver: Surges more than 3%

At the time of writing, spot silver was changing hands at $58.28, up 3.18% for the day as the US Dollar Index fell.

In the week ending November 28, spot silver surged nearly 13% on huge ETF inflows and Fed rate cut hopes.

Silver is also benefitting on inventory dislocation as Chinese silver inventory at SGE and SHFE warehouses have plummeted to almost decade-lows.

Gold/Silver ratio has plunged below the strong 200-month support at 73.25, which can boost silver further.

However, as US and Chinese economic indicators do not portray strong economies, investors need to be careful at the current levels.

Overall, silver can extend its rally to $62-$65 level in the coming weeks/months unless risk appetite weakens.

Buying the dips with stop-loss below $54 is the preferred strategy.

Note: Domestic precious metals prices are getting an additional boost from exchange rate moves as the USD-INR surged to a fresh record high on December 1 due to uncertainty over the US-India trade deal.

Ten-year US yields at 4.09% were up by nearly 8 bps, while 2-year yields rose approximately 1.1% to 3.53%. The US bonds fell on a surge of new corporate bond supply to begin in December. Bonds came under additional pressure on a possibility of Bank of Japan hiking rates in December that pushed the 10-year JGB to its highest level since 2008, while 2-year borrowing costs climbed above 1% for the first time since 2008.December Fed rate cut probability has surged to 88% from 24% on November 20.","Gold prices are likely to rise in the near-term, says Praveen Singh, Senior Fundamental Research Analyst- Currencies and Commodities at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.

New labour codes: Indian companies face higher wage expenses; manpower costs may increase 5-15% across sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-codes-indian-companies-face-higher-wage-expenses-manpower-costs-may-increase-5-15-across-sectors/articleshow/125654580.cms,"An AI-generated image

Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

Companies review hiring and pay structures

Indian companies are likely to see higher wage bills as they adjust HR policies and compensation structures to comply with the new four labour codes. Experts estimate manpower costs could rise 5-10%, or even more for some firms.The increase in wage expenses is largely driven by higher costs for benefits such as gratuity, overtime, bonuses, and leave encashment, which will now be calculated according to the new wage definition, said Sonu Iyer, national leader, people advisory services – tax at EY India. Labour-intensive sectors like manufacturing, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and companies with fragmented pay structures are likely to experience the steepest increases.Firms where variable pay and allowances make up a significant part of total compensation may see only moderate rises, said Viswanath PS, chief executive at Randstad India. ""In such cases, a 5-10% increase in manpower cost is a reasonable estimate, though the exact impact will vary by industry and the current compensation design,"" he said, as quoted by ET.Companies are also reassessing hiring models, particularly the mix between contract and fixed-term employment, while realigning salary structures to comply with the uniform wage definition, experts noted.""As remuneration in kind (if any) up to 15% will be treated as wages, all employers will now need to re-examine what components of their current compensation structures will be treated as 'wages,' and which ones will be excluded from the definition,"" said Atul Gupta, partner – labour and employment practice at Trilegal. He added that gratuity is likely to see the most significant impact among employee benefits.""An increase in manpower costs on account of the recent labour codes may go up in the 5-12% range for a typical organised employer. And if the workforce was over indexed on allowances or contract labour, it may be 10-15%, or more,"" said Prabir Jha, founder and CEO of Prabir Jha People Advisory.Highlighting the employee perspective, Sudhakar Sethuraman, partner at Deloitte India, said, ""The codes specifically prohibit the employer from reducing the wages of the employees…So employees stand to gain from labour codes,"" as quoted by ET.The government, however, believes that the significant reduction in compliance burdens under the new codes will balance out any additional employer costs, including those arising from overtime payments or mandatory health checks for workers.","Indian companies are likely to see higher wage bills as they adjust HR policies and compensation structures to comply with the new four labour codes.

Aviation lapses: Air India plane flies 8 times without valid certificate; DGCA investigation underway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/aviation-lapses-air-india-plane-flies-8-times-without-valid-certificate-dgca-investigation-underway/articleshow/125715864.cms,"A320 Grounded: Here Is Why 6000 Aircraft Across World Couldn't Fly | Inside Story Of Software Snag

What is the Certificate of Airworthiness ?





Air India had operated a 164-seater Airbus A320 on eight flights before an engineer finally detected a safety lapse and the aircraft was taken out of service.The flight, operated betwen November 24 and 25 according to sources cited by ET, was not suitable for flying as its airworthiness licence had already expired. The operations posed potential risk to the safety of passengers and the and the airline has suspended all those responsible for releasing the aircraft without a valid licence. The plane will stay grounded while the DGCA inquiry is underway.The case has surfaced at a time when the airline has been trying to reassure passengers about its safety record following the Dreamliner crash on June 12 that resulted in 260 fatalities.The Certificate of Airworthiness is issued by the DGCA and renewed every year after confirming that mandatory periodic maintenance has been carried out and the aircraft is safe to fly. Operating an aircraft without valid documents is treated as a serious offence. A government official told ET that the Tata group owned Air India could face heavy penalties, and suspension of top officials is also a possibility.The situation may create further complications for the carrier with its lessors, because flying with an expired licence can invalidate insurance.“By operating an aircraft which was not certified to be airworthy, the carrier has risked flight safety and (that of) all the passengers. This is a serious violation and not expected from a mainline carrier like Air India,” the official told ET.While the regulator conducts periodic spot inspections, it is the operator’s responsibility to ensure that aircraft remain airworthy. Senior engineers noted that modern software systems make it very difficult to overlook scheduled tasks such as certificate renewal or maintenance. Air India has an in-house Continuing Airworthiness Management Organisation (CAMO) that oversees the process.“An airline typically starts the work of renewal of its certificates at least three months before the due date so it is renewed before time,” a DGCA inspector said. “After the end of daily operations, when the aircraft is parked for night halt, an engineer checks whether all documents and approvals are in line. That the plane flew eight times with an expired licence raises a lot of questions about Air India’s safety culture. ”The DGCA is expected to categorise the incident as a Level 1 violation, a critical lapse affecting flight safety. It is the latest in a series of operational issues at Air India. Earlier, show-cause notices were served to the airline’s senior management, including chief executive Campbell Wilson, after it was found that several aircraft had components that exceeded their approved life span. A few months before that, the regulator suspended the head of engineering quality, the department responsible for internal audits to check compliance.The chain of issues illustrates the continuing struggle to restore the airline’s image almost four years after privatisation. To bolster engineering oversight, Air India is working with Singapore Airlines (SIA), which owns 25.1% of the carrier. Jeremy Yew, senior vice president of Singapore Airlines Engineering Services, has been deputed to Air India, and more SIA personnel are expected to join, a senior executive at the airline said.","Air India had operated a 164-seater Airbus A320 on eight flights before an engineer finally detected a safety lapse.

Which sectors should you bet on?

Within financials, asset quality remains resilient and well-capitalized balance sheets position lenders to benefit from improving liquidity conditions and a revival in credit growth following the recent rate cuts.

Consumption-oriented sectors should gain from GST simplification, personal tax relief and lower borrowing costs, supporting upgrades in discretionary demand.

Capital goods and industrials are poised to benefit from the next leg of the government-led capex cycle, which is expected to revive.

Meanwhile, the technology sector enters 2026 on stronger footing as the US rate cycle turns supportive and enterprise spending visibility improves, driven by AI-led transformation and multi-year digital adoption themes.

Going into 2026, long-term opportunities are likely to centre around consumption, financials, manufacturing scale-up and sustainability.

Consumption remains a core theme as tax reforms, rising incomes and easing borrowing costs support both mass-market and discretionary demand across autos, travel, retail and branded consumer categories.

The BFSI ecosystem should continue to benefit from the financialisation of household savings, stronger liquidity, improving credit growth and rapid digital penetration.

Healthcare also offers multi-year visibility backed by higher public spending, PLI-linked capacity build-out and rising insurance coverage. Manufacturing and supply-chain localisation — spanning semiconductors, defence, EMS and strategically incentivised sectors — is set to gain traction under the government’s self-reliance agenda.

Finally, early-stage sustainability themes such as EV batteries, recycling and circular-economy solutions are emerging as credible long-term growth vectors. Collectively, these themes align with improving earnings prospects and represent where the next leg of structural market leadership may evolve, says Menon.

Will RBI cut repo rate again? All eyes on December policy meeting; here's what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-rbi-cut-repo-rate-again-all-eyes-on-december-policy-meeting-heres-what-experts-say/articleshow/125721024.cms,"GDP and inflation - opposing forces at play

A room for rate cut

No change, says BoB

As the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) prepares to unveil its policy decision this week, economists and industry experts are divided over whether the central bank will cut rates or maintain its current stance.The meeting, which begins on Wednesday, has raised curiosity about the central bank’s decision. Here is what the experts say about the possibility and factors surrounding repo rate cut.In the second quarter of FY26, India’s GDP growth rose to 8.2%, prompting some analysts to anticipate a pause in policy action. The momentum might have continued in the third quarter too, on the back of continued rural demand and improved urban consumption. At the same time, prices have also come down. CPI inflation decreased to a series low of 0.25% in October, thanks to lower food prices. This is expected to moderate further and fall below RBI’s own forecast.Mehul Pandya, MD and Group CEO of CareEdge Ratings, noted the opposing forces at play.""Both these developments (of a continued strong GDP growth and multi-year low inflationary levels) are mutually opposing forces from an interest rate perspective.Central banks usually do not tend to cut interest rates during the periods of strong economic activity, represented by GDP growth. At the same time, the central banks usually respond to a low inflationary environment by cutting interest rates,"" ANI quoted Pandya as saying.He further added that India’s strong growth is a result of ongoing fiscal and structural reforms, but cautioned that global uncertainties and challenging trade conditions with key partners could influence the outlook.""On the balance, the environment does appear conducive for a rate cut next week, though with a limited room for any further expectations for 2026.""Taking a more optimistic stance, Mayur Modi, Co-founder and Co-CEO of Moneyboxx Finance Limited, argued that the record GDP growth provides the RBI with more policy leeway. He said, ""With inflation easing to multi-year lows and remaining comfortably within the RBI's tolerance band, the probability of a repo rate cut has strengthened meaningfully. Softening price pressures give the MPC more room to prioritise growth without risking macroeconomic stability. "" Modi added that a well-timed cut could support consumption cycles and boost credit demand across sectors.Rohit Arora, CEO and Co-Founder of Biz2X and Biz2Credit, also favoured a supportive approach. ""With inflation continuing to ease and financial markets increasingly pricing in a 25-basis point reduction, the upcoming policy review presents a strong opportunity for the RBI to adopt a more supportive stance,"" he said.Despite these calls for a cut, a report by Bank of Baroda suggests that the central bank is likely to maintain the repo rate at 5.50% and retain its neutral stance. The report noted that India’s economic performance has remained strong, with GDP growth surpassing expectations. Urban consumption and resilient rural demand are expected to sustain momentum into the third quarter, while private investment is showing signs of recovery, aided by a pickup in credit demand.On the inflation front, the report highlighted a sharp decline in CPI inflation. Core inflation remains above 4%, primarily due to higher gold prices, though benefits from lower GST rates have partly offset this.The report stressed that while the environment allows room for a rate cut, the RBI is likely to proceed cautiously given the strength of growth. Maintaining the current rate would also allow time for the effects of previous cuts to fully filter through the system. The central bank may consider additional monetary support later if tariff-related challenges persist.The MPC is scheduled to meet from December 3 to 5, with the policy decision to be announced on December 5 at 10 AM by RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra.",The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) prepares to unveil its policy decision this week.

Trade reset: China issues rare earth licences; questions persist over wider access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trade-reset-china-issues-rare-earth-licences-questions-persist-over-wider-access/articleshow/125719367.cms,"‘Good Policy In Place’: Rare Earth Expert On India’s National Critical Minerals Mission

Auto-linked suppliers receive clearances

Gap remains between Beijing and Washington

China’s rare earth industry is set for faster shipments to select buyers after authorities issued the first batch of new export licences, a step that follows months of disruption caused by Beijing’s tighter controls earlier this year. The move reflects a key outcome of the Donald Trump–Xi Jinping summit, according to Reuters.The approvals mark a shift from a system that forced companies to apply for each shipment individually, a process that created shortages across the auto supply chain and strengthened Beijing’s leverage in trade talks with Washington. Reuters reported that the new “general licences” were designed to ease those pressures and allow exports under year-long permits for specific customers.A source told Reuters that China has now granted these licences to several major suppliers, including JL Mag Rare Earth, Ningbo Yunsheng and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech, though some clients are still awaiting approval.JL Mag has received general licences for nearly all its customers, while Ningbo Yunsheng and Beijing Zhong Ke San Huan High-Tech have secured approvals for part of their client base, the source said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.The three companies and China’s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to questions.All three firms serve the automotive industry among others, according to their websites. JL Mag operates a subsidiary in Europe, and Ningbo Yunsheng says it supplies clients in Europe and the Americas.The new permits will add to, rather than replace, the existing licensing system. For now, only large Chinese rare earth companies qualify for general licences, though eligibility could widen if the rollout proceeds smoothly, the source added.The development narrows, but does not close, differences in how Washington and Beijing described the leaders’ summit in South Korea. The White House portrayed the general licences as effectively ending China’s rare earth controls, while Beijing has offered little public commentary and no indication its broader regime will be dismantled.It also remains unclear how widely the new licences will be granted or whether certain customers — including defence, aerospace or semiconductor-linked sectors — may be excluded.European companies, meanwhile, again raised concerns on Monday about delays and limited transparency in the existing export-control framework.","China's rare earth industry is set for faster shipments to select buyers after authorities issued the first batch of new export licences.

A320 Grounded: Here Is Why 6000 Aircraft Across World Couldn't Fly | Inside Story Of Software Snag

NEW DELHI: Air India has yet again earned regulatory ire, this time for operating eight commercial flights on an aircraft with a lapsed “airworthiness review certificate” (ARC). The regulator has ordered the aircraft to be grounded and initiated a probe into this lapse. Flying an aircraft without an airworthiness certificate means potentially endangering everyone on board.“Concerned personnel have been de-roaster with immediate effect pending investigation. On the instructions of DGCA, Air India is carrying out an internal investigation to identify deficiencies in their system and put corrective measures in place to prevent such failures from occurring in future,” the regulator said in a statement. AI had on Nov 26, 2025, informed the DGCA about flying the aircraft on an expired ARC for eight revenue sectors.In the past few months, AI has been ticked off by the DGCA for reasons like faulty rostering and scheduling of crew. A few weeks back, an AI pilot had operated a flight without undergoing mandatory corrective training after not being able to clear the bi-annual pilot proficiency check (PPC) - instrument rating (IR) test.While this is not an out of the ordinary occurrence, pilots have to mandatorily undergo corrective training and get their proficiency rechecked to a satisfactory level of performance before they can fly again.About the latest case involving operating an aircraft with a lapsed ARC, the DGCA said in a statement: “Under delegated authority, Air India issues ARC in respect of aircraft it operates. ARC is issued annually in respect of an aircraft after a comprehensive review of its maintenance records, physical condition and verification of compliance with all airworthiness standards. It acts as a validation of the aircraft's main ‘certificate of airworthiness’ (C of A. )”“As part of the merger process of Vistara into Air India in the year 2024, in respect of all the 70 Vistara Aircraft it was decided that the first ARC renewal post-merger will be done by the DGCA. Till date ARC for 69 aircraft has been issued by DGCA after satisfactory compliance by the operator. In respect of the 70th aircraft, the operator filed an application with the DGCA and subsequently the aircraft was grounded for engine change. During this period the ARC expired, however the aircraft was released for service after engine change,” the regulator said.Comments have been sought from AI on the lapsed ARC issue and are awaited.","The regulator has ordered the aircraft to be grounded and initiated a probe into this lapse.

"IPO boom continues! December set to be another big month; ICIC Pru, Juniper & more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ipo-boom-continues-december-set-to-be-another-big-month-icic-pru-juniper-more-whats-on-the-list/articleshow/125714179.cms,"India’s primary market is gearing up for a blockbuster year-end, with a string of public offerings in December signalling that the IPO boom of 2025 is far from over. The last month alone is expected to raise almost Rs 30,000 crore, making it one of the hottest month in what has already become a landmark year of record breaking equity issuances.December, the number of IPOs is set to soar to about 25, led by five major listings: ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co (Rs 10,000 crore), Meesho (Rs 5,400 crore), Clean Max Enviro Energy Solutions (Rs 5,200 crore), Fractal Analytics (Rs 4,900 crore) and Juniper Green Energy (Rs 3,000 crore).Meanwhile, October saw 10 IPOs, attracting Rs 45,188 crore, followed by nine issues in November that raised Rs 23,613 crore.Market watchers describe the momentum as evidence of both strong business confidence and a selective yet optimistic investor base.Neha Agarwal, managing director and head of equity capital markets at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, told ET that the strength of the pipeline reflects more than a rush to close the year. “The IPO rush is driven not by indiscriminate issuance but by a meaningful confluence of entrepreneurial energy and discerning investor appetite,” she said, pointing to the sharp investor preference for high-quality companies.“What's encouraging is the quality-first filtration investors are applying - strong management, governance and credible business models are being rewarded, while anything with uncertainty rightly faces pushback.”Alongside large offers, a second wave of mid-sized IPOs is also poised to raise capital. Wakefit Innovations (Rs 1,500 crore), Innovatiview (Rs 1,500 crore), Park Medi World (Rs 1,200 crore), Nephroplus (Rs 1,000 crore) and precision engineering player Aequs (Rs 1,000 crore) are among the next set of issuers. Meesho and Aequs have already confirmed their subscription window for December 3–5, while the rest are awaiting final calendar announcements.The surge has also been helped by the depth of liquidity in domestic markets. Systematic investment plan (SIP) contributions of about Rs 30,000 crore every month continue to offer a dependable capital base as foreign flows fluctuate. Domestic institutional investors have also delivered steady participation for two straight years, giving investment bankers confidence that the surge of issuance can be absorbed without market disruption.Another defining feature of the current cycle has been the dominance of offer for sale (OFS) deals, with close to two-thirds of recent IPO funding coming from shareholder exits. Despite this, the market has remained stable, said Gaurav Sood, managing director and head of equity capital markets at Avendus Capital. “We believe this is not just a year-end rush but the culmination of a record year for India’s primary markets,” he said. He added that the system’s liquidity strength has ensured smooth execution of large deals across multiple sectors. “When you combine this domestic flow strength with the proven ability to execute large and diverse deals across sectors, it’s clear why the market is comfortable running a heavy December calendar and why promoter confidence, filing volumes and broader IPO momentum are likely to stay elevated into 2026,” he told ET.The fundraising numbers reflect the same optimism. According to Agarwal, main-board IPO issuances have already crossed last year’s milestone of Rs 1.5 lakh crore, and the month has only just begun.","ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co (Rs 10,000 crore), Meesho (Rs 5,400 crore), Clean Max Enviro Energy Solutions ( Rs 5,200 crore), Fractal Analytics (Rs 4,900 crore) and Juniper Green Energy (Rs 3,000 crores) The last month alone is expected to raise almost Rs 30,000 cr.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125717019,imgsize-164788,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

'Equity dried up'





Funding hurdles delay expansion plans

Oppo, Vivo, Lenovo-Motorola, Haier, Midea and other top Chinese electronic companies are relying on group companies to fund their Indian operations, according to the Registrar of Companies filings. Most of the funds received are from external commercial borrowing route from linked parties.According to sources cited by ET, this comes as the entities face a roadblock in getting bank loans due to the absence of Press Note 3 (PN3) approval for equity funding and regulatory actions against some of these companies.Press Note 3 (PN3) rules, introduced back in 2020, stopped companies headquartered in neighbouring countries such as China from investing in India through the automatic foreign direct investment route. Every such infusion now needs government approval. The approvals have not come through so far, and people familiar with the matter say that regulatory action against some of these businesses has also made Indian banks wary of lending to them. As a result, most of these companies are now turning to external commercial borrowings (ECBs) from related parties.Before PN3, equity capital was the standard mechanism for financing Indian operations.However, that changed once the rules kicked in.Lenovo India is among the companies that have gone back to their parent groups for funds. Its filings show that it sanctioned unsecured loans of Rs 300 crore in FY25 to Motorola Mobility India, another Lenovo-owned firm, to meet working capital needs.Haier Appliances India has also tapped its parent, borrowing Rs 214 crore in FY25 from Haier Singapore Investment Holding for what has been described as a “business requirement”, according to statutory disclosures.Midea India has arranged an overdraft from Standard Chartered Bank, backed by a comfort letter from Midea Group Co in China. Long-term ECBs from Midea Electric Trading (Singapore) Co stood at Rs 448 crore as of March 2025.Registrar of Companies records accessed through Tofler show that scheduled payments on ECBs due to the holding company have been deferred without penalties.“In the immediate years after PN3, Chinese companies were struggling with funding as equity capital dried up,” a leading Chinese brand's senior executive told ET.“Then, there were multiple investigations against most of them by departments of income tax, revenue intelligence and the Directorate of Enforcement in relation to compliance of income tax, customs duties and foreign exchange regulations. This made local bank loans a challenge. So, ECB has become the favoured route.”The funding squeeze has not been limited to borrowings. Xiaomi has disclosed that Rs 4,820 crore belonging to its India business is currently tied up because authorities have frozen the subsidiary’s bank accounts. “The cases are currently at the hearing stages and not yet concluded,” said the company in its latest earnings report.Haier Appliances India has told the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade that it requires PN3 approval for fresh capital worth Rs 1,000 crore from its parent. The funds are meant for setting up a third factory. Since approval is still pending, the firm is now working on a potential stake sale in its India subsidiary to Bharti Group to secure money for the project.Other leading smartphone makers are also relying heavily on ECBs. Vivo Mobile India reported in an RoC filing dated August that it uses ECB proceeds for working capital, general corporate needs and plant-related capital expenditure. Vivo’s ECB exposure fell to Rs 1,668 crore in FY24 from Rs 2,875 crore in the previous year.Oppo Mobiles India’s latest filing shows that it received a non-current unsecured ECB worth Rs 1,667 crore from Grand King Ltd, an Oppo group company based in Hong Kong, in addition to a Rs 414 crore working capital loan from HSBC Bank in FY24. ECBs from related parties stood at Rs 3,699 crore in FY23. Oppo India also held a current ECB of Rs 2,084 crore from Grand King in FY24, ET reported.FY25 financial disclosures for some of these firms are yet to be filed.Despite the funding complications and regulatory challenges, Chinese companies remain dominant in India’s smartphone space. According to the latest findings from IDC India, eight of the ten most popular smartphone brands in the country are from China, with Samsung and Apple being the only exceptions.","Oppo, Vivo, Lenovo-Motorola, Haier, Midea and other top Chinese electronic companies are relying on group companies to fund their Indian operations.

""In response to a separate question, the minister also detailed the limits on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the banking sector. As per the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules 2019, FDI in PSBs is capped at 20%, while private sector banks are permitted up to 74 %.Highlighting the function of overseas investment, he pointed out that “FDI is considered as a major source of non-debt financial resource for the economic development, leading to long-term sustainable capital in the economy and contributes towards technology transfer, development of strategic sectors, greater innovation, competition and employment creation and supplement domestic capital, technology and skills for accelerated economic growth and development. ”Chaudhary, as cited by PTI, also provided an update on the sale process of IDBI Bank, confirming that the disinvestment will go ahead in line with the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA). The CCEA, at its meeting on May 5 2021, granted ‘in principle’ approval for a strategic disinvestment accompanied by a transfer of management control. The approval covered the sale of the government and LIC’s stake, subject to consultation with LIC and within the framework decided by the RBI.According to the minister, 60.72% of IDBI Bank’s shareholding has been put up for strategic sale along with management control.

Funding strain and index threat

Retail investors who chased Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin vision are now confronting heavy losses, as the turmoil around Strategy Inc.’s stock intensifies and leveraged products tied to it unwind sharply.The rout has erased gains built during the crypto mania and left funds tracking the company’s volatile bets struggling to retain assets. The developments were reported by Bloomberg.Strategy -- once seen as a simple route to hold Bitcoin through a listed stock — has dived more than 60% from recent highs. The company said on Monday that it had created a $1.4 billion reserve to manage dividend and interest payouts, a step meant to ease concerns it might be forced to sell Bitcoin if prices fall further.For many investors, that reassurance came too late. MSTX and MSTU, two funds offering double the daily return on Strategy’s stock, have each fallen more than 80% this year, placing them among the 10 worst performers in a US ETF universe of more than 4,700 products. A third fund, MSTP, launched in June, has dropped by a similar amount. Together, the trio has shed about $1.5 billion in assets since early October.Retail interest had originally surged when firms such as Defiance and Tuttle Capital Management rolled out these high-octane products to mirror one of Wall Street’s most visible Bitcoin-proxy trades.Strategy shares slid 34% in November. Bitcoin, down roughly 30% from its October peak, trades near $87,000, while the stock closed Monday 3.3% lower after falling as much as 12% during the day. Bitcoin advanced 0.5% as of 6.20am in London on Tuesday.“The recent pullback in Bitcoin has hit Strategy’s stock hard, and 2x leveraged plays like MSTX and MSTU turn that into even larger losses,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at ETF shop TMX VettaFi. “It’s a reminder that leveraged single-stock ETFs can look great on the way up, but can erase gains very quickly when the underlying trade goes the other way.”Defiance declined to comment. Tuttle Capital and GraniteShares, which is behind MSTP, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.At the centre of the market’s worries is mNAV, a metric comparing Strategy’s enterprise value with its Bitcoin holdings. The premium embedded in that ratio has largely evaporated, pulling it to about 1.15, a level executives have described as a caution zone. CEO Phong Le said on a podcast that slipping below 1.0 could force the firm to sell Bitcoin to meet payout obligations, though only as a last resort.The new reserve, financed through recent equity sales, covers at least 21 months of dividend and interest payments. But it has not quelled concerns over Strategy’s dependence on leverage, its reliance on retail flows, and the strain on its capital model.To keep buying Bitcoin, Strategy has repeatedly issued common stock — a move that dilutes existing shareholders. With its valuation premium narrowing, the company has shifted towards preferred shares and other costlier capital to sustain its crypto strategy.The ETF ecosystem linked to Strategy is also struggling. At least 15 products tied to the stock are currently trading, many down double digits this year. Combined assets for MSTX, MSTU and MSTP have fallen from more than $2.3 billion in early October to about $830 million, Bloomberg data show.The broader crypto slump — despite increased institutional participation and political support from the Trump White House — has dragged down miners, altcoins and firms with token-heavy treasuries. Leveraged ETFs, popular with at-home traders earlier this year, are among the hardest hit.These funds aim to deliver double Strategy’s daily move. In volatile markets, compounding returns — known as volatility decay — can steadily erode performance even if the underlying stock ends flat. When Strategy’s shares dropped and whipsawed, the ETFs amplified the losses.“Leveraged ETFs are generally a dangerous investment. A leveraged ETF on shares of a stock that levers up to buy a highly speculative asset is a risk profile of its own,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading.Strategy may now face removal from key benchmarks. Analysts at JPMorgan warned that the stock could be excluded from indices such as the MSCI USA and the Nasdaq 100, a shift that could unleash billions in passive outflows. The reversal is striking for a firm once viewed as a potential S&P 500 entrant.","Strategy shares slid 34% in November.

"Omnicom to slash 4,000 jobs: Media giant consolidates key agencies; AI disruption shapes industry landscape",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/omnicom-to-slash-4000-jobs-media-giant-consolidates-key-agencies-ai-disruption-shapes-industry-landscape/articleshow/125713117.cms,"Biggest Tech Layoffs of 2025: Job Cuts at TCS, Intel, Microsoft, Google and more

Omnicom will lay off more than 4,000 employees and merge several prominent advertising agency brands following its $13 billion acquisition of rival Interpublic Group.The job cuts will primarily affect administrative roles, with some leadership positions also impacted, reported the Financial Times on Monday, citing company executives.Omnicom CEO John Wren said. “The financial benefits would surpass the $750 million in annual cost savings initially projected to investors,” he added. Wren will remain chair and chief executive of the combined entity.The move comes as the advertising industry undergoes a major transformation, with artificial intelligence reshaping creative production and tech companies like Meta enabling businesses to produce ads faster and at scale. Omnicom’s acquisition of IPG is part of a strategy to regain momentum amid fierce competition from French ad giant Publicis and UK-based WPP.As part of the integration, creative agency DDB, founded in 1949, and marketing agency MullenLowe will be merged into Omnicom’s TBWA network. FCB, one of IPG’s largest global agency networks with roots dating back to 1873, will be absorbed into Omnicom’s BBDO, the report said.Executives noted that Omnicom’s restructuring should be seen in the context of similar changes at rivals such as WPP, which is also expected to reduce staff under new CEO Cindy Rose, according to the Financial Times.Interpublic Group had already cut about 3,200 employees in the first nine months of 2025, while Omnicom itself reduced its workforce by 3,000 last year, bringing total staff to roughly 75,000, the report added.","Omnicom will lay off more than 4,000 employees and merge several prominent advertising agency brands.

"Asian stocks today: Markets climb amid US rate cut hopes, Japan bond jitters; Kospi nears 2%, Nikkei up over 56 points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-today-markets-climb-amid-us-rate-cut-hopes-japan-bond-jitters-kospi-nears-2-nikkei-up-over-56-points/articleshow/125709502.cms,".

Asian markets mostly rose on Tuesday as investors focused on hopes of United States rate cuts and nerves around rising Japanese bond yields eased slightly.In Hong Kong, HSI rose 0.11%, rising 28 points to reach 26,061. Nikkei also rose 56 points to trade at 49,360 at 10:30 AM IST.South Korea's Kospi added 1.81% to 3,991.Meanwhile in China, Shanghai and Shenzhen were down 0.55% and 0.77%, respectively.The latest lift in stocks followed a muted trading session on Monday, but sentiments turned after another batch of weak US economic numbers strengthened confidence that the Federal Reserve is moving closer to cutting interest rates. Hopes of rate relief have repeatedly buoyed equities over recent weeks, helping markets erase the slump triggered earlier in November by jitters over a possible tech bubble.Expectations of a third straight cut gained further traction after multiple Fed officials indicated that preserving employment now takes priority over pushing down elevated prices. Recent figures have offered support for that shift in stance, with the broader economy, particularly the labour market, showing signs of softening while inflation appears largely stable for the moment.A fresh survey from the Institute for Supply Management revealed that US factory activity contracted for a ninth month in a row, reinforcing that narrative.With the macro signals favouring risk assets again, Asia entered Tuesday on firmer footing. Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all traded higher. Shanghai bucked the trend with a dip. Tokyo also managed to climb after suffering heavy losses the previous day, when Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda unsettled global markets by hinting at the possibility of an interest rate increase this month.Ueda’s remarks sent the yen sharply higher and pushed yields on Japanese two-year government bonds beyond the one percent mark, a level not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis. Although the Japanese currency steadied on Tuesday, the effects of the shock lingered. The comments contributed to a pullback on Wall Street following last week’s Thanksgiving rally and reduced appetite for risk, dragging the cryptocurrency market lower as well.Markets are now keeping a close watch on a scheduled auction of 10-year Japanese government bonds later on Tuesday, seen as a key test of sentiment following the recent spike in yields.Meanwhile in corporate news, one of the biggest moves in the region came from Seoul. Shares of Samsung Electronics jumped more than two percent after the tech heavyweight unveiled its first triple-folding smartphone. The company acknowledged that its price, more than $2,400, is likely to put the device beyond the reach of most consumers, but investors appeared enthusiastic nonetheless.","Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Wellington, Manila and Jakarta all traded higher.

"Starbucks settlement: Coffee chain to pay $35 mn to 15,000 NYC workers; Mamdani and others join striking baristas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-settlement-coffee-chain-to-pay-35-mn-to-15000-nyc-workers-mamdani-and-others-join-striking-baristas/articleshow/125708715.cms,"Starbucks, one of the world’s biggest coffee chains, has finally agreed to hand over about $35 million to more than 15,000 New York City workers after claims that shifts were slashed without warning and schedules kept in constant flux. The announcement landed on Monday, just hours before Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US Senator Bernie Sanders walked onto a Brooklyn picket line to visit protesting baristas.The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide. Workers argued that their demands are simple: better staffing and more stable hours. But frustration only grew as almost four years passed since baristas at a Buffalo branch first came together to strike against the organisation, and a contract has still not materialised. Since then, unionisation has spread to around 550 of Starbucks’ 10,000 company-owned outlets. A further 7,000 stores operate under licence in airports, supermarkets and other venues.Both the company and union workers dispute the scale of the strike’s impact. Even so, Mamdani, Sanders and a group of state and city officials added political firepower to the movement on Monday, joining scores of baristas and supporters outside a Brooklyn Starbucks.“These are not demands of greed — these are demands of decency,” Mamdani said. Some workers held oversized cut-outs of Starbucks takeaway cups, swapping the company’s branding with the union’s. Sanders said, “Starbucks has refused to sit down and negotiate a fair contract.”Strikers described a workplace buckling under pressure, understaffed shifts, unpredictable scheduling and online orders so complex that the list of ingredients sometimes stretches beyond the height of the cup. “It is the company's issue to give us the labor amount to schedule partners fairly, and they are not scheduling us fairly, no matter how much money we are making them,” said Gabriel Pierre, 26, a shift supervisor at a suburban Bellmore shop.Meanwhile, the Seattle-based chain has been trying to regain its financial footing. Cost-conscious customers have been pressing pause on premium coffees, questioning whether they still justify the price. Starbucks recently recorded its first rise in same-store sales in nearly two years, but restructuring costs, store redesigns and other changes dragged on profits in the July–September quarter.The settlement announced by New York City’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection further requires Starbucks to pay $3.4 million in civil penalties in addition to the $35 million earmarked for workers. Additionally, the company agreed to follow the city’s Fair Workweek law from here on.Starbucks said that it is committed to responsible operations and compliance with local laws, while acknowledging the difficulty of the rules in question. “This is notoriously challenging to manage,"" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said.Most hourly employees affected will receive $50 for each week worked between July 2021 and July 2024, the department confirmed. Staff who experienced violations after that window can still seek compensation by filing a complaint.The deal also guarantees reinstatement opportunities for employees laid off during recent store closures in the city.For many baristas, the fight continues. “I sure hope that it gives Starbucks an awakening,” said Kaari Harsila, 21, a shift supervisor from Brooklyn who joined the picket line.",The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide.

It reaffirms our commitment to developing advanced anti-infective solutions for the world and demonstrates what Indian science and innovation can achieve on the global stage.”Analysts expect the formal NDA approval to come through over the next six to nine months, with Zaynich to be reviewed under the fast track process.It will be interesting to watch how the company markets the drug in the US, and whether it enters into a licensing deal for the purpose, analysts told TOI.A novel β-lactam enhancer mechanism based Zaynich has garnered international attention for its potent activity against highly resistant Gram-negative pathogens—microbes responsible for prolonged hospitalizations and significant mortality worldwide.","Mumbai-based pharma firm Wockhardt announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for its novel, first-in-class antibiotic Zaynich.

US markets today: Wall Street falls as Bitcoin sinks; manufacturing slowdown and tariff pressures deepen concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-markets-today-wall-street-falls-as-bitcoin-sinks-manufacturing-slowdown-and-tariff-pressures-deepen-concerns/articleshow/125699059.cms,".

US markets moved lower on Monday, giving back part of last week’s gains as bitcoin and other once-popular assets continued to weaken. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% in morning trading, putting its five-day winning run at risk. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 204 points, also 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite edged down 0.5%.Earlier rally had been fueled by optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates at its meeting next week to support a cooling labor market. Those expectations remain strong, with CME Group data showing traders see almost an 88% chance of a rate cut, reported AP.Even so, yields on long-term US government bonds moved higher. This followed a rise in global yields after the Bank of Japan’s chief suggested that interest rates there could increase. When bond yields rise, they often draw investors away from riskier markets, putting pressure on stocks and cryptocurrencies in particular.Bitcoin, which had been around $125,000 in October, slid below $86,000 — a 5% more drop than yesterday. The decline weighed on crypto-linked companies: Coinbase Global fell 3.7% and Robinhood Markets dropped 4.6%.Strategy, previously known as MicroStrategy, tumbled 8% after saying it had raised $1.44 billion in US dollars through stock sales to help cover dividends on preferred shares and pay interest on its debt.Synopsys was among the strongest performers, rising 3.9% after revealing that Nvidia will invest $2 billion in the company as part of a deepened partnership. Nvidia, now the most influential stock on Wall Street, recovered from early losses to close 0.9% higher.Investors also reacted to early reports from the holiday shopping weekend. Spending during Black Friday and Cyber Monday appeared to exceed projections despite ongoing concerns about the broader US economy. Amazon inched up 0.4%, while Best Buy slipped 1.9%.Global markets showed mixed results. France’s CAC 40 index eased 0.3%, partly due to a 5.1% decline in Airbus. The company said that most of its 6,000 A320 aircraft had been updated after a software issue discovered over the weekend that could affect flight controls. Airlines faced minor disruptions as they rushed to apply the fix during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 1.9% amid worries that the country’s long-standing near-zero interest rates may soon rise as inflation remains above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target.In the US, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 4.08% from 4.02% at the end of last week. It briefly went past 4.09% before easing after a report showed US factory activity declined more than expected. Manufacturers reported weak hiring conditions and said they are “still more focused on managing headcount than on hiring,” as quoted by AP.Several companies also mentioned ongoing challenges related to tariffs, with one saying, “Conditions are more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty.”","The S&P 500 was down 0.4% in morning trading, putting its five-day winning run at risk.

Bitcoin fell sharply on Monday, slipping below $86,000 in early Asian trade as renewed selling hit the cryptocurrency market at the start of December.The world’s largest digital asset dropped by 6%. Ether also declined more than 7% to around $2,800, while other major tokens, including Solana also registered steep losses. Traders said that the broader slump signals a fresh risk-off mood among investors, according to a report by Bloomberg.The crypto market has been struggling since a wave of leveraged positions. The market worth nearly $19 billion was wiped out in early October, shortly after Bitcoin touched a record high of $126,251. The token shed nearly 17% in November, although a brief recovery last week had lifted prices above $90,000.“It’s a risk-off start to December,” said Sean McNulty, APAC derivatives trading lead at FalconX.“The biggest concern is the meager inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and absence of dip buyers. We expect the structural headwinds to continue this month. We are watching $80,000 on Bitcoin as the next key support level,” McNulty added.Sentiment weakened further after comments from Strategy Inc. CEO Phong Le, who said the company could sell some of its massive Bitcoin holdings if required to support dividends.Strategy holds about $56 billion worth of Bitcoin.Adding to market jitters, S&P Global Ratings last week downgraded its stability assessment of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, citing the risk of under-collateralization if Bitcoin prices continue to fall.Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China issued fresh warnings over the risks of virtual currencies and urged tighter action against illegal crypto activities.Market participants are now watching key US economic data due this week, which could influence expectations on future interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that he had finalized his choice for the next Fed chair, fueling further speculation over policy direction in 2026.Crypto traders caution that volatility may remain high in the near term as global financial markets react to shifting rate expectations and regulatory signals.","The world’s largest digital asset dropped by 6%.

Stock markets in Asia opened on a steady note on Monday as optimism over a possible US interest rate cut supported risk appetite at the start of the final month of 2025.Investors also kept a close watch on the Japanese yen, which strengthened amid expectations of a near-term policy shift in Tokyo.The yen advanced to 155.64 per US dollar as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered a speech in Nagoya. Ueda said the central bank would weigh the “pros and cons” of raising interest rates at its next policy meeting in December, a comment that investors parsed for signals on the timing of a long-awaited hike.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady at 703.19, up 23.5% so far this year and on track for its strongest annual performance since 2017. Japan’s Nikkei, however, slipped 1.3% in early trading.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed more than 1%, helping support broader Asian stocks, though US futures traded lower during Asian hours.“The risk bulls roll into December feeling positive about directional bias,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone. As earlier concerns faded, he said, investors were now driven by the fear of missing out and underperforming benchmarks.Markets will be guided this week by US economic releases on manufacturing, services and consumer sentiment. Analysts say volatility could rise as traders weigh whether the economy is cooling without slipping into recession.“With the US data void finally being filled and a busy economic calendar ahead, December looks set to be a merry one for volatility hunters,” said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at StoneX in Brisbane.He added that a controlled slowdown would likely keep sentiment upbeat while weakening the US dollar, which typically softens at year-end.The dollar index was little changed at 99.414, after falling 8% so far this year, most of the losses coming in early 2025.Investors will also track remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later on Monday, as dovish signals have increased confidence that a rate cut could come this month. Traders are now pricing an 87% probability of a cut.Holiday shopping trends remain another key indicator. US online spending on Black Friday hit a record $11.8 billion, up 9.1% from last year, according to Adobe Analytics.In commodities, oil prices rose after OPEC+ decided to keep output unchanged for the first quarter of 2026 amid worries about a potential supply glut. Brent crude futures gained 1% to $63.03 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude added 0.99% to $59.16.Meanwhile, Japan’s finance minister issued yet another warning against sharp foreign-exchange swings, saying recent yen moves were “clearly not driven by fundamentals.”Authorities have struggled to slow the currency’s slide as traders weigh doubts over the timing of the next rate hike and fiscal risks under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.","MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was steady at 703.19.

A history of dramatic and contested predictions

Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings after posting on X that “the biggest crash in history” has already begun. His message paints a picture of an economy under pressure from rapid technological change and widening global instability. Citing an AI-driven erosion of jobs and deepening stress in real estate markets, Kiyosaki argues that the financial landscape is shifting far faster than most expect, and that only those who prepare for a more turbulent era will be able to shield themselves from the heavy losses he believes lie ahead. In the latest post, he adds that the “best option” for investors is silver, while also urging them to consider gold during volatility.Kiyosaki’s latest message draws directly from his 2002 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, reprinted in 2013, where he predicted a historic market meltdown. His new post links the downturn to artificial intelligence, claiming job losses across the US, Europe and Asia are now triggering the market spiral he warned about more than two decades ago. He maintains that silver remains the “best option” for investors looking to protect themselves.Silver prices have continued climbing. As of 29 November 2025, the metal sits at about $56.70 per ounce, a 13 percent increase from the $50 level Kiyosaki referenced on 23 November. Yet major market indicators tell a more measured story. The S&P 500 has dipped roughly 5 percent from recent highs, suggesting turbulence but not the total global crash Kiyosaki describes.Kiyosaki has made bold crash forecasts repeatedly, including several in 2025 that did not unfold as predicted. His latest warning has sparked scepticism and online pushback, with figures like Grant Cardone publicly dismissing the claims. Still, the post taps into a broader and unresolved debate over AI’s economic impact and whether today’s volatility is a temporary shock or the beginning of something far more severe.","Robert Kiyosaki has reignited debate over his long-running market warnings.

India Says US Trade Deal Is 'Only Matter Of Time' As Tariffs Reshape Bilateral Trade Negotiations

US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime, saying the duties had made the country “Rich, Strong, Powerful, and Safe,” in a post on his Truth Social account.Trump argued that because of the tariff framework he “set in place,” the United States now holds “all the cards,” asserting that the measures had stopped wars, strengthened alliances and prevented other nations from “ripping off the United States anymore.”He claimed the stock market and retirement savings had surged, adding that “Inflation, Prices and Taxes are down,” and that education was “being brought back to the States.”Trump also said the US military and southern border were “the strongest they have ever been,” contending that the country is “respected again, respected like never before.”He attributed these outcomes to what he described as “Strong leadership and tariffs.”The president’s remarks come at a sensitive moment, as the Supreme Court is preparing to rule on the extent of presidential authority to impose duties without congressional approval.Tariff revenues have climbed sharply in recent months, as per Fox Business, reaching a record $34.2 billion in October.Total duty collections were $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, and the Treasury has reported $41.6 billion in revenue so far in fiscal 2026.Since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, collections jumped from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, with August and September together bringing in $62.6 billion, reported Fox Business.US businesses pay these import taxes but often pass on the costs to consumers, though Trump has recently lifted some duties to ease price pressures.Trump has pledged that tariff revenues could finance a one-time $2,000 dividend for low- and middle-income households.As per Fox Business, US trade representative Jamieson Greer recently said that the payments would not fuel inflation, stressing they would provide “welcome relief” without altering the broader economic outlook.Trump ended his post by urging Americans to “pray to God” that the Supreme Court “do the right thing for America.”","US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his sweeping tariff regime.

Holiday rush: US retailers eye Black Friday lift; shoppers hunt deals despite weak sentiment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/holiday-rush-us-retailers-eye-black-friday-lift-shoppers-hunt-deals-despite-weak-sentiment/articleshow/125642803.cms,"Black Friday no longer pulls Americans from Thanksgiving dinners for midnight mall queues, but it still draws more in-store traffic than any other day of the year — and remains the unofficial start of the US holiday shopping season.This year’s kickoff came as US consumer confidence slipped following the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to The Conference Board, AP reported. Retailers say shoppers have grown more selective and deal-focused, even as they continue to spend on big seasonal moments, creating what executives describe as a “halo effect”.“Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said ahead of Black Friday.At Macy’s Herald Square in New York City, early-morning crowds searched for steep discounts on shoes, clothing, linens and cosmetics after doors opened at 6 a.m. Footwear — marked down by 40–50% — was among the busiest sections. But unlike in past years, the atmosphere was calm.Veronica Nam, 68, picked up Nike sneakers for her husband and spent $256 on Lacoste bedding she estimated was half-price. She said she would wait until after Christmas to buy gifts for other relatives amid fluctuating tariffs under President Donald Trump and several years of elevated prices.“Food is very expensive,” she said.Nearby, 19-year-old Nicholas Menasche was shopping with his mother before heading to Best Buy for video games. The banking intern plans to spend around $1,200 this holiday season — roughly the same as last year. “I’m here to buy stuff. Shoes and clothes,” he said. “It’s a great tradition. The stores are open really early.”Retailers spent spring and summer navigating tariff unpredictability, shifting shipments ahead of import taxes and absorbing some costs to avoid raising prices. Circana data showed 40% of general merchandise in September saw price hikes of at least 5% versus early 2025. Toys, housewares, baby products and sports gear were especially affected; 83% of toys saw at least a 5% price rise. Nearly 80% of US toy sales involve items made in China — a sector hit with steep Trump-era tariffs.Still, malls and analysts reported strong momentum heading into Black Friday. At Minnesota’s Mall of America, foot traffic has exceeded 2019 pre-pandemic levels in recent weeks, said Jill Renslow, the mall’s chief business development and marketing officer. “We’re seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,” she said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.”Online spending is also growing briskly. Between Nov. 1 and Nov. 23, consumers spent $79.7 billion, Adobe Analytics said — up 7.5% from a year earlier and ahead of its 5.3% forecast.Mastercard SpendingPulse projects holiday sales from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24 will rise 3.6%, compared with last year’s 4.1%.“Clearly, there’s uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn’t seem like it’s changing how they are showing up for this season.”","Black Friday draws more in-store traffic than any other day of the year. Retailers say shoppers have grown more selective and deal-focused, even as they continue to spend on big seasonal moments. This year’s kickoff came as US consumer confidence slipped following the federal government shutdown.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125642801,imgsize-920720,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Canada’s economy staged a stronger-than-expected recovery in the third quarter of 2025, expanding 2.6 per cent year-on-year after a contraction in the previous quarter, according to new data from Statistics Canada, AFP reported.The rebound was fuelled by an improved trade balance and higher government spending, offsetting the drag from US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which has weighed on Canadian growth and clouded the country’s trade outlook.CIBC economist Katherine Judge said the print “was well above the consensus forecast,” noting that analysts had broadly expected growth of around 0.5 per cent.Statistics Canada said the improvement was led by declines in imports alongside a slight uptick in exports. “Imports dropped and exports edged up. Increased capital investment was driven by government capital spending, as business investment was flat,” the agency said.The drop in imports was the largest since 2022, the agency added.A sharp rise in federal outlays also contributed to the growth momentum, with government spending on weapons systems surging 82 per cent.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground.Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change, too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,imgsize-633411,width-400,resizemode-4/106921271.jpg"

Space sector start-up Sisir Radar to develop SAR on L/P band SAR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/companies/space-sector-start-up-sisir-radar-to-develop-sar-on-l/p-band-sar/articleshow/104558111.cms,"CHENNAI: Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge with its projects for development of “L/P band Continuous Wave SAR (synthetic aperture radar) payload for LEO Small Satellites” and “Unfurlable, Electronically Steering Antenna for L/P band SAR payload” for Indian Air Force (IAF), said a top company official.The company is promoted by former Director at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Tapan Misra and the brains behind the Indian space agency’s RISAT series of SAR satellites as well as the Dual Frequency SAR on the Chandrayaan 2 orbiter that is currently circling the moon.""A grant of Rs 3 crore is also there for development of the products,"" Misra told IANS.Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR is a special kind of imaging radar technology that can provide extremely accurate high resolution imagery of the terrain through clouds, smoke and dust even in pitch dark conditions. SAR imagery provides much higher resolution than other forms of remote sensing technology such as hyperspectral and multispectral. SAR is a critical technology for strategic reconnaissance and planning as well as for disaster management.According to Misra, winning the challenge in just over a year of floating the company is a major booster.He said L and P band SAR have an advantage over other frequencies (like X band) when it comes to penetration capabilities through rain, clouds, foliage and vegetation in a tropical country like India, and underground penetration capabilities in dry terrain.Continuing further, he said the L band SAR will provide 1 metre resolution, spotlight resolution in Stripmap mode. The current industry standard is 5-10 metre in L band. Misra said both the L and P band will operate simultaneously from a satellite borne SAR. Recently, Sisir Radar successfully developed and tested the world’s highest resolution L-Band SAR fitted on a drone. With 0.2 metre resolution, this is by far the highest L band SAR in the world, he said.","Space sector startup, Sisir Radar Private Ltd has hit success at the prestigious iDEX DefSpace Challenge.
